It is intended as a comprehensive reference for methods and compositions and has a number of useful features. For example, you can: Search for existing methods and compositions by name, title, or a large number of other criteria; Display the blue line of methods or compositions , as well as other detailed information; If you register for an account, you will gain the ability to contribute material to the Composition Library, and take full advantage of its more powerful tools. For instance, you will be able to: Define new compositions and methods . Create collections of methods or compositions (e.g. your personal favourites, or the hottest new 23-spliced). Find compositions which are true to a particular method, or methods which are true to a particular composition via an extended search . Registered users can also ask questions, raise issues and request bespoke compositions from other Complib users. Using the Help You can navigate the Help by using the sidebar: simply click on the section you'd like to read. Clicking on a section will expand it to show any subsections it contains. You can also look for help on a specific topic using the search field at the top of the sidebar. Giving feedback Our hope is that this Help documentation can help you get to grips with Complib and how it works. That being said, the Composition Library is a work-in-progress, and the Help is no different. You can provide feedback on the Help via Complib's Issues page. When raising a Help-specific issue, please use the dedicated Documentation issue type, as that will allow us to deal with it separately from issues specific to Complib itself. When to raise an issue If... you encounter a problem when using the Help; you notice something about the Help which doesn't seem correct (and you're reasonably sure); you have feedback about a section of the Help which is unclear or could be expanded upon; you have feedback about the way the Help is structured; then these are good reasons to raise an issue. When not to raise an issue There are certain circumstances under which we would ask you not to raise an issue. Change ringing is an art with a very long history, and its technical aspects have been subject to constant development within the change ringing community for centuries. Complib is intended to serve the needs of change ringing as it is currently practised . To this end, both Complib and the Help reflect the current Central Council Framework for Method Ringing wherever possible. Neither Complib itself nor this Help documentation are designed to act as fora for debate on the details of the current Framework, nor indeed should they. Such debate is a crucial part of change ringing culture, but this is not the appropriate place for it. A Note on Terminology The change ringing terms used in this documentation are those specified in the Central Council's Framework for Method Ringing , and reflect the definitions given there. It is assumed for the purposes of using the Help that you are familiar with at least some of this language. Definitions have been included in the Help wherever it is felt this might aid understanding. However, the Help is not intended as a replacement for the Central Council Framework, and does not attempt to give exhaustive definitions for every term used.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#composition-library-help","text":"The Composition Library , also known as Complib, is an interactive tool for all change ringers, not just conductors and composers.

Complib allows you to quickly look up the blue line and rows of a method, as well as anything else you might want to know about it. In addition, Complib allows users to define their own methods using place notation . Complib contains a large number of compositions , which are specified callings for a performance. These range in scope from simple practice-night touches to full peals and long lengths. Users can search for compositions fitting various criteria, publish compositions of their own , and rate their favourites. You can even request compositions from other users. Collections are as their name suggests: collections of methods, compositions or both. They are a convenient way to organise information in one place, with links to the relevant Complib pages. The Libraries Methods, compositions and collections on Complib are contained in one or more designated libraries , of which there are four: CCCBR A method-specific library. Contains all methods officially named and rung in compliance with the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing . This library is maintained by the Central Council's Technical & Taxonomy Workgroup. Provisional A method-specific library. Contains methods that, at the time they were named and rung, did not qualify for inclusion in the Central Council's Methods Library, but which may become eligible in future.

To get started, click on Create new > New composition in the navbar or dropdown menu: The Add composition page The Add composition page ( https://complib.org/composition/add ) has a number of fields which allow you to specify certain properties of your custom composition. Click on the name of a tab below to go to a dedicated page explaining how to use it. General Specify high-level information about the composition such as its title, composer/arranger, number of parts, and so on. Methods Specify which methods are used in the composition, including custom definitions of existing methods and their method mnemonics. Calls Define the calls used in the composition, together with their corresponding calling positions . This tab is often not needed, as most compositions use calls which Complib provides by default. Calling Edit the calling, or sequence of calls, which defines the composition. Performances Add performance information. Mostly used when uploading historical compositions. References Link the composition to collections within the Composition Library. Validating and saving compositions If Complib is able to parse the composition as entered, then its generated title, composition layout and blue line will be displayed at the bottom of the page. Complib will automatically attempt to validate any composition it can parse. Clicking the Validate button will force a re-validation. A composition which passes validation can be saved as a private composition by clicking the Save button. If the composition does not pass validation, one or more validation errors will be displayed. The composition layout and blue line displays will highlight certain specific errors, to aid in troubleshooting. Non-critical warnings may also be given. Validation errors If Complib encounters a critical problem when attempting to validate the composition, an error message will be displayed. All errors must be cleared before a composition can be saved . There are a number of different error types. Most errors will give an indication of how to clear them. The following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more common errors: Error: Composition is false and cannot be saved unless overriden in the General tab The composition as specified is false (that is, not true). See Composition properties > Truth for an explanation of what it means for a composition to be true. Since the vast majority of compositions which change ringers want to ring are true, Complib will not allow false compositions to be saved and published by default. However, this behaviour can be overridden with Allow save if false under the General tab . A false composition will be indicated with a next to the title on its composition page and in search results. Error: Composition is not a round block. The composition as specified does not end at the same row it started from. There are various things which can cause this to happen, but most often it is due to a mistake in the calling. Error: Rounds reached with unprocessed calls. The composition as pricked reaches rounds before the composition's calling (as defined under the Calling tab ) has been finished. There are a number of different reasons you might be seeing this error: Number of Extents is too small If the value of General > Extents has been set incorrectly, Complib may expect the composition to finish earlier than it should. If your composition contains multiple extents, you should check that the Extents value reflects that. Mistakes in the calling The calling itself may contain errors. See Calling > Troubleshooting for help debugging your composition's calling. Incorrect coursehead mask(s) Coursehead mask(s) may have not been set correctly, leading to the calling being misinterpreted. Error: Unable to prick composition, or other errors need to be cleared. Complib is not able to prick (generate the rows of) the composition as it has been defined. Usually this means that some other error is preventing Complib from parsing the composition. Error: Maximum false row limit reached. Complib will not automatically stop pricking a composition as soon as it runs false. However, in order to prevent the pricker from entering an infinite loop, there is an upper limit on the number of false rows which will be generated. This error means that the composition has reached that upper limit, and no more rows will be pricked in the blue line display . Validation warnings When validating a composition, Complib may generate one or more warnings. These contain information about the composition which you may wish to take into account before saving and/or publishing it. However, warnings by themselves do not prevent compositions from being saved. Tab-specific warnings and errors A number of warnings and errors relate to specific tabs in the composition editor. In such cases, the validation readout will list the tab which is responsible for causing the warning or error. Information on how to clear tab-specific warnings and errors can be found on the Help pages for each tab, accessible via the sidebar. See above for a brief description of the tabs. Layout display A parsed composition will be laid out by Complib at the bottom of the page. For an overview of the various parts of a composition layout, see Composition pages > Layout . The appearance of the layout is determined by the current configuration of the composition layout options . The layout options can be adjusted by clicking on the cog next to the Validate button. Note The format in which another user sees the composition is determined exclusively by their own display settings. The appearance of the Layout display and Blue line on the Add composition page have no bearing on how a composition is saved, and will not affect how it will appear to other users . However, adjusting the Layout display and Blue line options here can help you to see how the composition might appear to users with different configurations, and can be useful when debugging the composition if it is not pricking correctly. Blue line Underneath the layout of a parsed composition, Complib will also give the pricked rows of the composition in a dedicated Blue line tab. The tab can be expanded by clicking on its name. When expanded, it will look something like this: The appearance of the blue line display is determined by the blue line display options you have configured. These can be adjusted by clicking on the cog at the top right of the tab. For more info on the blue line display for compositions, see Composition pages > Blue line . Publishing compositions A custom composition which is successfully saved to Complib becomes a private composition and is given its own composition page . Private compositions are only visible to their owners, until they are published or shared via public link. To publish a private composition, click the Publish button in the toolbar at the top of the composition page. This will add the composition to Complib's Public library, so that it is visible to anyone using the site. Warning A published composition cannot be un-published (though it can still be edited or deleted). You should make sure that you want a composition to be visible before publishing it. Sharing via public link Normally, a private composition is only visible to the user who owns it. However, you might want to share your private composition with others. You can do this by sharing via a public link. To generate a public link, click on the share button in the toolbar at the top of the composition's page. This will open a window containing a link which you can copy to your clipboard. Sharing a private composition via public link does not publish it . If you want your private composition to be visible to anyone who uses Complib, you should consider publishing it instead. Editing and deleting compositions To edit a custom composition, click on the edit button in the toolbar. This will open the composition in the editor, allowing you to change its various properties. To delete a custom composition, click on the delete button in the toolbar. This will bring up a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to delete the composition. Clicking on Confirm Delete will delete the composition from Complib. Warning Unlike deleted methods , compositions are deleted immediately and can no longer be recovered. If you have shared the composition via a public link , or if the composition has been linked to from an external site such as BellBoard , the link will no longer function. You should exercise great caution when deleting a composition which has been shared publicly, especially if there is any possibility of its being rung. If a composition has already been rung, you should avoid deleting it altogether.

The composition as specified does not end at the same row it started from. There are various things which can cause this to happen, but most often it is due to a mistake in the calling. Error: Rounds reached with unprocessed calls. The composition as pricked reaches rounds before the composition's calling (as defined under the Calling tab ) has been finished. There are a number of different reasons you might be seeing this error: Number of Extents is too small If the value of General > Extents has been set incorrectly, Complib may expect the composition to finish earlier than it should. If your composition contains multiple extents, you should check that the Extents value reflects that. Mistakes in the calling The calling itself may contain errors.

The calling specifies the sequence of calls (such as bobs and singles) which need to be made during a performance, including changes of method in Spliced. Note In the explanation which follows, it will be assumed that you know how to read compositions. If you are not already familiar with how compositions are typically laid out and interpreted, you should visit How to read compositions before continuing. Editing the calling To edit the calling, simply click on a cell in the table and type a value to enter it into that cell. Multiple cells can be selected by clicking and dragging. Alternatively, you can click on a cell, hold Shift , and then click on another cell to highlight a rectangle with those cells at opposite corners. Hold Ctrl / \u2318 Command and click to select multiple individual cells. Backspace / Delete will delete any values in selected cells. Right-clicking on a cell will open a contextual menu, allowing you to manipulate the table by inserting or removing table rows and columns: Copy-paste from other sources In many instances you can save time by copy-pasting a calling from another source. This might be another web page, or a file on your computer. With the calling highlighted in the source, Ctrl + C ( \u2318 Command + C ) will copy. Then, in the Calling tab, select a single cell and press Ctrl + V ( \u2318 Command + V ) to paste. The calling will be pasted into the table such that the selected cell is in its top left corner. In many instances you will have to clean up the calling after copy-pasting, as the text formatting in the source can cause problems. Copy-pasting tends to work best if the original is in plaintext format , such as a composition attached to a performance on BellBoard. Anatomy of callings Callings are entered into the Calling tab laid out by courses . If a composition was originally laid out by leads, you will need to reinterpret this into a course format as you enter it into the Calling tab. Callings versus Layout It's important to remember that a composition is defined by its calling , but not by its layout or style of presentation. The same composition can be represented in many different ways. Indeed, Complib gives users a lot of control over the way that any composition appears to them. When defining a custom composition on Complib, the most important (and pretty much only) task is to correctly define the calling. A typical composition, when entered into the Calling tab, might look like this: Example: 5000 2-Spliced Bob Major by Edward W Martin Since you know how to read compositions , it should be clear from the above example that there is a direct correspondence between the way the calling is entered into the table and how it would normally be written when laid out by courses. Some composition callings may not have all the features labelled here, while others may have more. The following sections contain information on all the calling features Complib supports and how to use them correctly. Calling positions Calling positions are column headers which signal to Complib when a call in the table should occur. A calling position must be a single uppercase or lowercase letter [A\u2013Z, a\u2013z] or a positive whole number . A calling position must be entered in the top row of a column, with nothing in any cell above it. Failing to do this will cause the calling positions to be incorrectly identified as other objects, such as calls or named blocks. Tip: Repeated calling positions There is no restriction on the number of times that a given calling position appears. There are circumstances in which you may find it convenient to have the same calling position at the head of multiple columns in the Calling tab. Compositions generally two types of calling position: named positions (represented with letters), or numbered positions . While it's common to only use one type or the other in a given composition, you are free to use a mixture of both. A special kind of named position, unique to Stedman Triples, is used in twin-bob compositions . Named calling positions Named calling positions indicate that a call should be made when an observation bell reaches a specific part of the course. By default, the observation bell is the heaviest working bell. Most compositions use a small number of well-known calling positions with special names, such as H (Home) and W (Wrong). Complib also uses these named calling positions by default. See the dedicated page on calling positions for a full list of the default positions and their names. Custom named positions can be created by defining a new Mnemonic and Heading in the Calls tab . A different observation bell can also be specified using observation masks . Numbered calling positions Numbered calling positions indicate a number of leads/divisions since the last coursehead . When using numbered calling positions, you must provide additional information to Complib to allow it to count the leads/divisions correctly. If possible, you should specify appropriate coursehead masks in the General tab. You can also directly control the length of courses in the Calling tab itself. Since a course can be arbitrarily long, a numbered calling position can be any positive whole number. However, in practice it is very unusual to have courses requiring numbered calling positions with more than two digits. Bear in mind that anyone calling the composition has to count up to that number! Twin-bob calling positions For historical reasons, many compositions of Stedman Triples use a special type of calling position which indicates pairs of calls . Such \"twin-bob\" compositions use four named calling positions whose names derive from the work of the observation bell (usually the 7). Each is usually shortened to a single letter: Going in S low, H alf turns, L ast whole turn and going in Q uick. In a typical course, these correspond to numbered positions as follows: Position Bobs at... Diagram S 3 and 4 H 5 and 6 L 7 and 8 Q 12 and 13 When entering a twin-bob composition in the Calling tab, you should use numbered calling positions . Complib will automatically recognise the twin-bob calling positions and display them appropriately in the composition layout (provided the user viewing it has Layout Options > Rows > Expand twin bobs disabled in the composition layout options ). Twin-bob positions: Things to watch out for Limitations Complib will only recognise the twin-bob calling positions if the composition contains bobs at those positions and no others . Courses with non-standard lengths The numbered positions given above assume that all the courses have a standard length of 14 sixes. Twin-bob compositions which use different course lengths (i.e, because the observation bell is affected by singles ) can still be recognised as such by making use of consecutive colon syntax to start a course at a different numbered position. Calls Calls such as bobs and singles are indicated by symbols and numbers in cells which are beneath calling positions . Multiple calls can be entered into the same cell, including calls of different types. Calls are always processed in left-to-right reading order. The majority of compositions use a small set of standard call symbols. Accordingly, Complib has a standard set of default call symbols which it will interpret automatically. Any other symbols must be explicitly defined in the Calls tab . Defining custom calls When defining a custom call in the Calls tab, remember that you must specify an observation mask , Mnemonic and Heading for every named calling position at which that call occurs (it's not necessary to do this for numbered calling positions). Symbols and calling position headings in the Calls tab should exactly match those in the calling, otherwise you will get a validation error. Multiple bobs The default bob call is unique: it can be represented in the calling using numbers as well as the standard dash (\u2013) symbol. A positive whole number in a cell beneath a calling position will be interpreted to mean that many consecutive bobs at that calling position. In particular, the number 1 can be used as an alternative to the dash (\u2013) symbol. Multipart compositions & call alterations Many compositions have callings which are supposed to be repeated a number of times\u2014these are known as multipart compositions. When defining a multipart composition, you should enter the calling for the first part into the Calling tab, and indicate the parthead(s) under the General tab . This will prompt Complib to repeatedly apply the calling until rounds is reached. Some multipart compositions require alterations to the calling in specific parts. The Calling tab has a robust syntax which allows you to specify these alterations, such as inserted or omitted calls, and even method substitutions in Spliced. Insertion and deletion A basic call alteration looks something like this: Calls The call or sequence of calls affected by an alteration is always enclosed in [square brackets]. The opening and closing brackets do not have to be in the same cell, or even the same row. Pairs of brackets can even be nested inside each other. The only requirement is that every left [ bracket is paired with a corresponding right ] bracket later in the calling. Part number(s) Directly in front of the opening bracket are the numbers of any parts in which the alteration takes place. When multiple part numbers are listed, they should be separated by a pipe character ( | ). Insertion/deletion indicator Directly in front of the part number(s) is a symbol which indicates whether the calls in brackets are to be inserted (+) or deleted (-) in the numbered parts. If entered correctly, the call alteration will be marked with a superscript number in the generated layout, with a corresponding footnote of the form: [ # ] Include/omit in part(s)... Call substitution A more complex form of call alteration is a call substitution . This is when a call (or sequence of calls) is replaced with a different call (or sequence of calls) in a particular part. A call substitution has the following form: Original calling The call or sequence of calls to be replaced in the numbered parts. Separated from the substituted calling by a comma . Substituted calling The call or sequence of calls to be substituted in place of the original calling in the numbered parts. Substitution indicator A combination of the insertion and deletion indicators. Can be entered by typing both + and - (in either order) in front of the part number(s). The original and substituted calling can be in the same cell, or spread across multiple cells and rows: The only requirement is that the parts of the syntax appear in their proper order when read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. In the above example, all nine calls between the left bracket and the comma are replaced by the lone bob to the right of the comma. If entered correctly, the original calling will be marked with a superscript number in the generated layout, with a corresponding footnote of the form: [ # ] Replace bracketed calls with (substituted calling) in part(s)... Calling alterations and partheads Be aware that if a calling alteration causes the next parthead to be different from what it would otherwise have been, you must make sure that the new parthead is included in the set generated by the specified parthead(s) under the General tab . Example: Simple six-part Consider this very simple touch of Plain Bob Minor: To turn it into a multi-part composition, we should identify the first parthead, which is 142356. Entering this into the General > Parthead(s) field will prompt Complib to expect a multipart calling. In the calling tab, we enter the first part only, with the required calling substitution in parts 3 and 6: Now we get an error: By looking at the generated layout, we can see the reason: Complib is still only expecting 3 parts, even though our calling indicates that there are 6. In the validation readout, Complib gives the generated partheads: Partheads: (3) 123456, 142356, 134256 This is too few. The partheads after the first single are missing. The fourth parthead in the touch, which would be 123456 without the calling substitution, is actually 124356 . Adding this parthead to General > Parthead(s) fixes the issue, and now the composition pricks correctly: Alterations affecting methods The same syntax for call alterations also applies to any methods specified in the calling, allowing you to add, omit, or replace sequences of methods in certain parts. Calling repetitions There are many instances where it can be useful to repeat a section of the calling a set number of times. Calls , method sequences , and named blocks can all be enclosed in ( round brackets ) with a number in front: n ( ... ) This will prompt the pricker to repeat the calling inside the round brackets n times. The brackets can span multiple cells . The only requirement is that a left bracket must be paired with a corresponding right bracket. Examples: Repetitions of calls, blocks and method sequences Five consecutive bobs at W rong Single H ome, single M iddle, repeated The named block B called four times The method sequence ABC called twice Calling repetitions in layouts Calling repetitions are written out in full in the composition's layout display, regardless of the viewer's layout options. If you would like to explicitly signal to the conductor that a section of the calling is used multiple times, consider using a named block instead. Infinite repetition A hash ( # ) symbol in place of a number indicates that the section in brackets should be repeated indefinitely . The pricker will continue this \"infinite\" repetition until the composition comes round (or runs false). Only one infinite repetition can exist in the calling. The calling before the repeated section will be processed as normal, but everything after it will be ignored. A common use for infinite repetitions is in compositions of Stedman . Courses, courseheads, etc. Courseheads and leadheads, while a key feature of many composition layouts, are not entered into the Calling tab directly . Instead, Complib derives them from the calling when it pricks the composition. The main way of signalling to Complib which rows should be considered courseheads in your composition is by entering appropriate coursehead masks under the General tab . However, some compositions use many different courseheads and require a large number of masks, some of which might not be known in advance. In such cases, it is often preferable to control the courseheads directly from the Calling tab. Setting course length with colons A course can be forcibly ended at any point in the calling by inserting a colon ( : ) in a column headed by a numbered calling position . This signals to Complib that the next coursehead will come after a number of leads equal to the column heading. Example: Colon in cell with a call. Entering the above into the Calling tab would produce a course which is 5 leads long, with a bob called at the end of lead 5 to bring up the coursehead. Colons in the calling are processed just like calls, i.e. in reading order. However, colons are not calls, and the two are processed independently of one another . The first colon in the calling will set the length of the first course, regardless of any calls. Similarly, a call appearing after a colon in reading order may nevertheless occur \"before\" it, if the calling position for the call is reached before the number of leads specified by the colon. Example: Colon ignoring calls. Looking at the above example, you might think that the first bob occurs at the end of the second lead of the touch. However, the colon at position 1 sets the length of the first course to one lead regardless of any calls . This means that the first course ends after just one lead, before the call at 2 can be processed. The bob at 2 occurs in the second course, at the end of the third lead of the touch. The bob at 3 happens at the end of the lead after that. Starting courses from different numbered positions By default, numbered calling positions are counted starting from 1. However, in some situations it is desirable to start counting from a different number in a particular course. A colon at a numbered calling position will restart the course from that numbered position, provided the previous course was ended with a colon, and there are no calls between the two colons. Colons: Things to watch out for Colons are only valid at numbered calling positions Colons set a course's length equal to a number of leads. Inserting a colon at a named position (such as H ) is not valid, and will cause an error. Colons disable coursehead masks If there are any colons in the calling, all coursehead masks will be disabled. This means that colons are all-or-nothing: if you want to use a colon, then you must use them to specify the length of every course in the touch. Colons are not included in the layout Colons are a purely internal signal which forces Complib to behave a certain way. They are not rendered in a composition's layout, regardless of user settings. Similarly, if a calling position is used with colons to manipulate course length, but no calls ever occur there, then that calling position will not appear in the composition layout. Methods Compositions which involve changes of method must indicate this in the Calling tab using the method mnemonics defined in the Methods tab . Method mnemonics must appear in a column which has the word \" Methods \", and nothing else, in its top row. The heading is not case-sensitive: methods, METHODS and MeThOdS are all equally acceptable. There can be multiple Methods columns if desired. An X in the Methods column indicates a lead of the method whose mnemonic is X. XXY would indicate two leads of method X, followed by a change to method Y. Method mnemonics are processed in reading order across all Method columns in the calling. When the last mnemonic in the calling has been processed, any additional leads will be pricked using the last indicated method. A touch which comes round at the end of multiple consecutive leads of method X only needs to specify mnemonics up to and including the final change to method X. Infinite repetition in compositions of Stedman Compositions of Stedman, which define quick and slow sixes with separate mnemonics Q and S in the Methods tab, use an indefinite repeat of #(QS) by default. This loop does not need to be included in the Calling tab. However, if a composition of Stedman starts from any row of a slow six, the implicit loop must be overriden with an explicit #(SQ) loop in the Calling tab. Stedman in spliced Because all changes of method after an infinite repeat are ignored, they cannot generally be used when Stedman is spliced with other methods. When entering the calling for such compositions, you must specify the sequence of alternating quick and slow sixes by hand. Method alterations in multipart callings Alterations to changes of method in multipart callings use the same syntax as for calls ( see above ). Named blocks Some compositions which do not reduce to a simple multipart calling nevertheless contain repeated sections, or blocks . For compactness, it can be useful to give a name to such a block which can stand in for its full calling. To designate a section of the calling as a named block, the calling must have a column with the word \" Blocks \", and nothing else, in its top row. The heading is not case-sensitive, and there can be multiple Blocks columns. Entries in the Blocks column are block names . Block names can contain any number of upper and lowercase letters [A\u2013Z, a\u2013z] , but not numbers or other symbols. If a table row contains a block name, the whole table row is included in a block with that name. Adjacent table rows are included in the same block if their block names are the same. Table rows can be included in multiple blocks at once . This requires the use of multiple Blocks columns. If two blocks overlap, then one of the blocks must be fully contained inside the other . Once a block has been defined, the block name can be used in the calling in place of the contents of the block. Named blocks are expanded by the pricker when it reaches them in the calling. Like calls, blocks are processed in reading order. Unlike calls, block names must occupy separate cells . A block can be called multiple times in a row by enclosing the block name in ( parentheses ) with the number of instances in front, or by entering the block name in multiple adjacent cells. Example: A and B blocks Example: 5120 6-Spliced Surprise Major by Marcus C W Sherwood . The above calling is reflected in the layout as: Example: Nested A, B and C blocks Example: 10371 Stedman Caters by Robert Dennis . The above calling, which includes nested blocks, is reflected in the layout as: Notice that block A appears twice inside block B: in both explicit form and as its block name. Similarly, block B appears twice inside of block C. Note You will not see named blocks in the composition layout if Rows > Expand named blocks is selected in your layout options .

A special kind of named position, unique to Stedman Triples, is used in twin-bob compositions .","title":"Calling positions"},{"location":"compositions/adding_compositions_tabs_calling/#named-calling-positions","text":"Named calling positions indicate that a call should be made when an observation bell reaches a specific part of the course. By default, the observation bell is the heaviest working bell. Most compositions use a small number of well-known calling positions with special names, such as H (Home) and W (Wrong). Complib also uses these named calling positions by default. See the dedicated page on calling positions for a full list of the default positions and their names. Custom named positions can be created by defining a new Mnemonic and Heading in the Calls tab .

Such \"twin-bob\" compositions use four named calling positions whose names derive from the work of the observation bell (usually the 7).

Twin-bob positions: Things to watch out for Limitations Complib will only recognise the twin-bob calling positions if the composition contains bobs at those positions and no others . Courses with non-standard lengths The numbered positions given above assume that all the courses have a standard length of 14 sixes.

Block names can contain any number of upper and lowercase letters [A\u2013Z, a\u2013z] , but not numbers or other symbols. If a table row contains a block name, the whole table row is included in a block with that name. Adjacent table rows are included in the same block if their block names are the same.

To edit any value in the table, simply click on the relevant cell, then type a new value. Multiple cells can be highlighted by clicking and dragging. Alternatively, you can click on a cell, hold Shift , and then click on another cell. Hint Unlike the Methods tab , you do not need to enter anything into the Calls tab in order to create a valid composition. This is because Complib has a number of default calls which account for the majority of those used in actual compositions. It's recommended that you leave the Calls tab empty unless your composition requires explicit call definitions. Complib will automatically remove call definitions that it considers to be unnecessary before any composition is saved. Call Type & Symbol These fields determine which of a number of standard types the call falls under, and what symbol is used to represent it in the composition's calling . Complib gives you the flexibility to define calls in whatever way you want. However, most compositions tend to use one of a small number of standard call types. Some of these types (Bob, Single, etc.) are widely used, have commonly accepted meanings, and are often represented with a set of standard symbols. Others are rarer and may have seen a variety of historical uses, or may be wholly modern innovations. The default behaviour of some call types depend on the default calls of the method(s) currently defined for the composition. However, since there is no need to define any of the default calls explicitly (and in fact Complib will remove any such extraneous definitions), the below examples are included more as a guide as to what each call type \"usually\" means. A call symbol can be any lowercase letter [a\u2013z], or a dash (\u2013) , with the constraint that all call symbols in a composition must be unique . The standard call types and their default symbols are: Bob Default symbol : \u2013 The simplest, most common type of call. In single-hunt methods and principles, a bob generally replaces a place made at/after the lead- or section-end with another made elsewhere in the row. Example: Plain Bob, 4ths place bob The diagrams below show the leadend of Plain Bob Minor with no call (top) and with a standard \"near\" bob (bottom). The bob replaces 2nds over the treble with 4ths over the treble. Example: Double Norwich Court Bob Major, 6ths place bob Double Norwich Court Bob Major with no call (top) and with a standard \"far\" bob (bottom). The bob replaces n ths place over the treble with ( n \u20132)'s place over the treble. Example: Stedman Triples, Stedman bob The six-end of Stedman Triples with no call (top) and with a standard \"Stedman\" bob (bottom). The bob replaces n ths place over the six-end with ( n \u20132)'s place over the six-end. In twin-hunt methods, a bob generally replaces n ths place before the lead end with 3rds made before the lead end. Example: Grandsire Triples, Grandsire bob Grandsire Triples with no call and with a standard \"Grandsire\" bob. Single Default symbol : s The second most common type of call. Singles are the counterparts to bobs, in the sense that they usually involve two extra places made in addition to the one(s) made at a standard bob. Example: Plain Bob, 4ths place single The diagram below shows the leadend of Plain Bob Minor with a standard \"near\" single. The single replaces 2nds over the treble with 2nds, 3rds and 4ths over the treble. Example: Double Norwich Court Bob Major, 6ths place single Double Norwich Court Bob Major with a standard \"far\" single. The single replaces n ths place over the treble with ( n \u20132)'s, ( n \u20131)'s and n ths place over the treble. Example: Stedman Triples, Stedman single The six-end of Stedman Triples with a standard \"Stedman\" single. The single replaces n ths place over the six-end with ( n \u20132)'s, ( n \u20131)'s and n ths place over the six-end. Example: Grandsire Triples, Grandsire single Grandsire Triples with a standard \"Grandsire\" single. Here, 2nds and 3rds are made over the treble at the leadend, in addition to the thirds made before the leadend. Plain Default symbol : p A utility call, used to prevent the pricker from inserting another call at the corresponding position. Plains should only ever be used to help Complib interpret a composition correctly: plain calls are not displayed in the composition's layout . There are two cases in which the use of plain calls is required. To force the pricker to ignore a calling position, to prevent the next call in the calling from being applied too soon. This quite often happens in compositions which specify calling positions by a number of leads after the course end. Example: Grandsire Triples The above composition of Grandsire Triples begins with a single at 1. The next call is at 2 in the following course. However, na\u00efvely putting a bob at 2 in the calling will cause Complib to wrongly insert the call immediately instead of waiting until the next course. To prevent this, the composition makes use of a plain call at 2 to force the pricker to wait until the next time the calling position is reached to apply the bob. The plain call is not displayed in the layout. To prevent Complib from interpreting a phantom parthead as a true parthead. Phantom partheads are repeated parthead rows which need to be ignored in multi-extent compositions. In most cases, they are ignored automatically because Complib will not look for a parthead until all calls in a part have been used. In the rare instance that a phantom parthead occurs between the last call and the true parthead, a plain call is needed to suppress it. In a few instances, it may be necessary to define a new calling position on the last row of the part. Example: Erin Doubles The above composition of Erin Doubles has 6 true partheads: 12345, 13245, 23145, 21345, 31245 and 32145. An Erin six which contains one of these partheads will also contain two of the others, so this composition has a large number of phantom partheads. Most of these are ignored, because there are calls remaining in the part. However, the six after the final single at 4 contains two phantom partheads in addition to the true parthead at the six end. The pricker will pick the first of these by default, which is incorrect. To prevent this, a plain call is inserted at 5 in the final course. By making a clone of the composition (NB: must be logged in) and examining the Calls and Methods tabs, we can see that a new Lead position of LE has been used to define a plain call at the six end. Try deleting the plain at 5, and note the effect it has on the Blue Line display. Big Bob Default symbol : x Used by default to represent: Near calls: A 6ths place bob for stages Royal and below; A ( n \u20134)'s place bob at stages above Royal. Far calls: A ( n \u20134)'s place bob. Big Single Default symbol : none Notionally a counterpart to the big bob. Has no default behaviour. Bob Single Default symbol : b This rare call type takes its name from those used by John Holt in his landmark 10-part composition of Grandsire Triples . By default, it represents: Near calls: 1456 at even stages; 1456 n at odd stages. Far calls: 1( n \u20134)( n \u20133)( n \u20132) at even stages; ( n \u20134)( n \u20133)( n \u20132) at odd stages. Double Default symbol : d Generally used for a call which extends the standard single with two additional places made. Example: Plain Bob Major with a 123456 double Plain Bob Major with a standard double: 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths and 6ths are all made over the treble at the leadend. By default, represents: Near calls: 123456 at even stages; 123456 n at odd stages. Far calls: 1( n \u20134)...( n \u20131) n at even stages; ( n \u20134)...( n \u20131) n at odd stages. Extreme Default symbol : e By default, represents 125 in Doubles. Has no default behaviour at other stages. Omit Default symbol : o By default, represents 1 in Doubles. Has no default behaviour at other stages. Trim Default symbol : t Used to indicate a call which often (but not always) changes the length of a lead. Usually a trim will skips changes within a method's lead, or substitutes some of the method's changes with a shorter sequence. Requires a Changes replaced value to be specified. Fill Default symbol : f Used to indicate a call which often (but not always) changes the length of a lead. Usually a fill inserts extra changes within a lead, or substitutes some of the method's original changes with a longer sequence. Requires a Changes replaced value to be specified. Jump Default symbol : none This call type must be used if the call involves Jump changes and uses Jump place notation . Special Default symbol : none Notation The place notation of the call. If the call affects multiple changes, the notation will have multiple elements. Changes replaced This value is only used with the trim and fill call types, in order to specify how many changes (if any) are to be replaced with the change(s) in the Notation column. If a lead originally has length L , and a trim or fill call changes that length to M by inserting or substituting a sequence of N changes, then: Changes replaced = L \u2013 M + N All values in the above equation must be positive. This means that for fill calls, where M \u2265 L , the Changes replaced value must be less than or equal to N .

Fills 5040 Kent Treble Bob Royal by John Reeves Trims 5099 Compton Castle Surprise Major by Robert D S Brown 5000 41-Spliced Surprise Minor by Alexander E Holroyd Lead position name The unique identifier for a Lead position at which the call can occur. This can be anything you want, so long as it exactly matches a corresponding Methods > Lead position name entry under the Methods tab . The Lead position name will appear in the composition's layout as part of a custom call definition. However, if the call uses the LE Lead position name (see below), this will be omitted from the layout. Default Lead positions Many of the default call types have a default Lead position name which they use. Since they correspond to common calling positions, you may wish to use them even when definining custom calls. The common ones are: LE Short for \"lead end\". Used by default for: Near/far/Grandsire bobs and singles; Plains; Big bobs and big singles; Bob singles; Doubles and extremes. This calling position, being by far the most commonly used, will not be explicitly named in the composition's layout as part of the call's definition. SE Short for \"section end\". This is used for Stedman-type bobs and singles by default. HL Short for \"half lead\". Used for trims and fills by default. Mnemonic Heading Only used when defining a custom calling position, or when specifying an observation bell which is not the highest numbered bell. The heading must be a single uppercase or lowercase letter [ A\u2013Z, a\u2013z ], or left blank. The heading value is used as a column heading for the corresponding calling position in the composition layout when laid out by courses; the heading is inserted after the call's symbol in the layout when laid out by leads, or when a calling alteration is given. The heading used should exactly match a calling position heading used under the Calling tab . Observation mask Only used when defining a custom calling position, or when specifying an observation bell which is not the highest numbered bell. An observation mask is a row mask which gives the position of the observation bell after the call is made at the calling position indicated by the Heading value. Example: 2nd as observation In this composition of Yorkshire Surprise Royal, the 2nd is the observation bell: all the calls are made in reference to its position, rather than that of the tenor. To achieve this, observation masks have been specified for all the calling positions used. These can be seen under the Calls tab by opening a clone of the composition (NB: must be logged in): Each observation mask specifies the position of bell 2 after the call at the corresponding calling position. All other bells are represented using wildcards ( x ). Further examples For more examples of compositions using the Calls tab, see the Examples reference collection .

The bob replaces n ths place over the treble with ( n \u20132)'s place over the treble. Example: Stedman Triples, Stedman bob The six-end of Stedman Triples with no call (top) and with a standard \"Stedman\" bob (bottom). The bob replaces n ths place over the six-end with ( n \u20132)'s place over the six-end.

Plains should only ever be used to help Complib interpret a composition correctly: plain calls are not displayed in the composition's layout . There are two cases in which the use of plain calls is required. To force the pricker to ignore a calling position, to prevent the next call in the calling from being applied too soon. This quite often happens in compositions which specify calling positions by a number of leads after the course end. Example: Grandsire Triples The above composition of Grandsire Triples begins with a single at 1. The next call is at 2 in the following course. However, na\u00efvely putting a bob at 2 in the calling will cause Complib to wrongly insert the call immediately instead of waiting until the next course. To prevent this, the composition makes use of a plain call at 2 to force the pricker to wait until the next time the calling position is reached to apply the bob. The plain call is not displayed in the layout. To prevent Complib from interpreting a phantom parthead as a true parthead. Phantom partheads are repeated parthead rows which need to be ignored in multi-extent compositions. In most cases, they are ignored automatically because Complib will not look for a parthead until all calls in a part have been used. In the rare instance that a phantom parthead occurs between the last call and the true parthead, a plain call is needed to suppress it. In a few instances, it may be necessary to define a new calling position on the last row of the part. Example: Erin Doubles The above composition of Erin Doubles has 6 true partheads: 12345, 13245, 23145, 21345, 31245 and 32145. An Erin six which contains one of these partheads will also contain two of the others, so this composition has a large number of phantom partheads. Most of these are ignored, because there are calls remaining in the part. However, the six after the final single at 4 contains two phantom partheads in addition to the true parthead at the six end. The pricker will pick the first of these by default, which is incorrect. To prevent this, a plain call is inserted at 5 in the final course. By making a clone of the composition (NB: must be logged in) and examining the Calls and Methods tabs, we can see that a new Lead position of LE has been used to define a plain call at the six end.

When creating a new custom composition, this is usually the tab that you will use first. Complib will attempt to infer as much information as it can about a composition based on data you have already entered. In particular, several fields in the General tab will automatically update other tabs when populated. This can save a lot of time when defining a custom composition. The sections on this page describe the entry fields on the General tab in detail. Validation errors and warnings specific to fields in the General tab are listed at the end of the section pertaining to that field. Title This field specifies the user-defined title of the composition. This is different from the generated title , which is provided automatically by Complib upon validation. The user-defined title is how the composition will be referred to elsewhere in the Composition Library once it is published, such as on the home page or in search results. The user-defined title can be anything you want: Complib has full Unicode support, so there's nothing to stop you from using titles like \"\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\" or \"\u4e94\u5343\u56db\u5341 B\u0336\u030a\u0344\u0308\u0347r\u0338\u0344\u0330i\u0335\u0304\u0319s\u0335\u0358\u0346\u0346\u0348\u0319\u0330t\u0335\u030c\u0309\u031do\u0336\u034c\u0346\u035d\u0326\u0354l\u0336\u030a\u031c \u0338\u034b\u0303\u0341\u033b\u0355\u0330S\u0337\u035b\u0305\u0327u\u0336\u0360\u0307\u033d\u031e\u035a\u031er\u0336\u0344\u035b\u0344\u0339\u0349\u0349p\u0336\u0306\u0349r\u0338\u0310\u0346\u035d\u0359\u033c\u0330i\u0334\u0352\u031b\u0355s\u0337\u035d\u0344\u032a\u033be\u0334\u0357\u0313\u0354\u035c \u0335\u0340\u031b\u033b\u0328M\u0338\u0350\u0303\u031c\u0355\u0327a\u0337\u0313\u0300\u0320\u033c\u031ej\u0338\u0340\u030f\u035b\u0331o\u0334\u0344\u0342\u0359\u031dr\u0336\u030e\u0328\u032e\u0332\" if you really want to. However, if you intend to publish the composition, it is best practice to use a title which corresponds closely to the generated title. This makes it easier for others to identify important information about your composition at a glance. The generated title formats are: Length + Method name + Class + Stage , for single-method compositions; Length + (# of methods)-Spliced + Class + Stage , for spliced-compositions at a single stage; Length + (# of methods)-Spliced + Stage 1 and Stage 2 , for mixed-stage compositions. Complib will use the user-defined title to automatically populate certain other data fields if possible. This is another good reason to match the style of generated titles. The other fields which Complib will attempt to infer from the title are: Stage Method (for compositions which are recognised to be for a single method) Title warnings and errors Warning: Does not start with the pricked length. The title provided does not start with a number which matches the length of the composition as pricked by Complib. With rare exceptions, composition titles begin with their length. Warning: Does not match pricked method. The title provided does not contain the full name of the method which is being used to generate the composition's rows. With rare exceptions, you should aim for these to match. Opus This field allows you to specify an Opus for the composition. Some composers use an Opus to help distinguish between compositions which might otherwise have the same title, or to highlight a notable feature of the composition. Some example compositions using an Opus are: 5088 Bristol Surprise Major Op. 4 by Donald F Morrison; 5016 6-Spliced Maximus Op. Classic by David J Pipe; 5014 Stedman Cinques Op. Bobs only by Mark R Eccleston. Text entered in the Opus field will be automatically appended to the end of the composition's title whenever it is referenced elsewhere in the Composition Library. For this reason, there is no need to include it in the Title . The Opus text will be listed in the form Op. [text] . Stage This field is a drop-down menu which allows you to select the stage the composition is designed for. For mixed-stage compositions, this should be the highest numbered stage. The stage of a composition indicates how many bells are being rung. Many stages have historical names which must be learned. The table below gives the names for every stage at which Complib can accept compositions. N Stage name N Stage name N Stage name 2 Two 13 Sextuples 24 Twenty-four 3 Singles 14 Fourteen 25 Twenty-five 4 Minimus 15 Septuples 26 Twenty-six 5 Doubles 16 Sixteen 27 Twenty-seven 6 Minor 17 Octuples 28 Twenty-eight 7 Triples 18 Eighteen 8 Major 19 Nonuples 9 Caters 20 Twenty 10 Royal 21 Decuples 11 Cinques 22 Twenty-two 12 Maximus 23 Twenty-three Stage warnings and errors Warning: is not the same as stage in Title The stage specified does not match the stage name in the Title field. In almost all cases these should be the same. The warning will also be displayed if: No stage name is included in the Title field; or The Title field contains multiple stage names , even if one of them matches the stage specified. An exception to this last point is where exactly two stage names are used with the word \"and\" between them, and one of these matches the stage specified. In this case the composition is interpreted as being mixed-stage . Composer details This field allows you to list the names of people or other named entities (such as computer programs) which were involved in creating a composition. To add an attribution to the composition, click on Add composer . This will create a new attribution, which has two parts: an attribution type and a name field . To delete an attribution, click the cross to the right of the name field. Warning: adding multiple attributions You should only ever add one composer name per attribution . If you want to attribute the composition to multiple people, you must add them separately by clicking Add composer to bring up additional attribution fields. You should generally avoid attributing a composition to the same person in multiple different ways (see Attributions in search results, etc. ). Composer name This is a text field in which you can enter the name of the person or entity which you wish to attribute. Complib will attempt to auto-complete the name using all the registered composer names in its database. Clicking on a composer's name in the drop-down list will add that name to the text field. Warning: Composer names You should not add anything to the Composer name field other than a person's name . Similarly, you should exercise great care when entering a composer's name, as any mistakes will be reflected in Complib's Report data and will have to be corrected manually. If the name you enter does not match an existing composer, then saving the composition will create a new composer page under that name. You should make sure that the name is listed correctly before saving or publishing a composition attributed to a new composer. Attribution type This field is a drop-down menu which allows you to further specify the kind of attribution you want to make. These attribution types do not have set definitions, and to some extent they are open to interpretation. However, most have commonly accepted meanings. When submitting a composition which was produced by someone else, you should use an attribution type which corresponds with their wishes whenever possible. The types of attribution are: Composed by The most common type of attribution. Used to identify the person or entity primarily responsible for creating the composition. Jointly composed by For cases in which a team of people were jointly responsible for creating the composition. You should add one attribution of this type for each person you wish to jointly attribute the composition to. Arranged by Generally used in cases where the composer considers the composition to be an arrangement of one previously published. Generated by Used to identify a computer program which was responsible for producing the composition. Selected by Generally used to identify someone who chose the composition from a set generated by a computer program. After Used to identify another composer who inspired the composition. As opposed to Inspired by , this usually means that a particular stylistic feature or prior composition is being imitated in some way. Inspired by Used to identify another composer who inspired the composition. Also attributed to Generally used to identify other composers who have previously been credited with producing the composition. Attribution ordering There is an implicit order of priority between the attribute types, given by the order in which they appear in the drop-down menu. This determines the order in which attributions are listed on the composition's page as part of its layout . If multiple names have the same attribution type, they will be listed on the same line in lexicographical order. Attributions in search results, etc. When a composition appears in search results, or in certain other places such as the Recently Published section, all its attributions will be listed after the composition's title in the format: [Title] by [Name 1], [Name 2], ... , and [Name N ]. Complib will not identify whether any of the listed names are identical, which means that the same name may appear multiple times. For this reason, you should generally avoid attributing a composition to the same person in multiple different ways. Attribution warnings and errors Warning: [Name] will be added as a new composer. The entered name does not match any existing composer in Complib's database. Saving the composition will create a new composer page with the same name as the attribution. You should only make an attribution using a new name if the name does not appear in the drop-down list . You should also make sure that the name is listed correctly before saving or publishing a composition attributed to a new composer. Year, month or date composed This field lets you specify a year, month or date when the composition was composed. Dates are given in the format [Day][Month][Year] and will appear in the composition's properties tab . It's not necessary to specify a full date, as often it is either not known or unnecessarily specific. For example, you might want to record the date as a month and year (e.g. Feb 2003 ), or simply a year (e.g. 1987 ). There are a number of different ways a year, month or date can be entered. The following are all equivalent ways of entering the same date: 1/1/10 1-1-2010 01/01/2010 1 Jan 2010 1 January 2010 Year The year can be given as either a two- or four-digit number. If a two-digit number is used, it is assumed to represent a year in the present century, unless that date would be in the future, in which case it is assumed to be in the previous century. Month The month can be entered as a one- or two-digit number, or as a short or long month name. If a month is specified, but no year, then the year will be assumed to be the same as the current year in Local Time. Day The day can be entered as a one- or two-digit number. Date warnings and errors Error: ____ is invalid. The text entered in the date field does not match any accepted date format. You should use one of the formats described above. Error: ____ is before 1650. Composition dates must fall after 1650, as the earliest known method, Grandsire, dates to around then. If you have good reason to believe you are in possession of a composition dating from before 1650, you should immediately notify the Central Council (as well as anyone else who will listen). Error: ____ is in the future. Composition dates must be in the past with respect to the present date in Local Time. If you have good reason to believe you are in possession of a composition originating from the future, you should immediately seek medical attention. Parthead(s) This field allows you to specify one or more partheads. In a composition that has multiple parts, a parthead is the first row of one of the parts. Partheads must be valid rows, and must match the currently specified stage . If more than one parthead is entered, they must be separated by commas ( , ). Complib will use any specified partheads to generate a set of partheads. The size of this set depends on the partheads themselves, as well as the order in which they are entered. Specifically, Complib generates the set of partheads by repeatedly transposing any defined parthead by itself, and by any which were defined before it. Example: Parthead 135264 Suppose that your composition uses the parthead 135264. Complib will repeatedly apply the transposition implied by this parthead to obtain the additional partheads 156342, 164523 and 142635. These generated partheads do not themselves generate any new partheads, so these four partheads (together with rounds) form a closed set. Example: Partheads 123465, 123645 Partheads 123465 and 123645 together will generate a set of six partheads: 123465, 123645, 123546, 123654, 123564 and 123456. The same set will be generated regardless of the ordering of the two specified partheads. It is important to bear in mind that the ordering of the custom partheads can change the resulting set of generated partheads. The next example demonstrates this. Example: Partheads 123564, 124536 The two partheads 123564 and 124536 will produce a total of nine generated partheads. However, the members of those sets depends on which order the two given partheads are specified in. 123564, 124536: 123456, 123564, 123645, 124536, 124365, 124653 , 125346, 125463 , 125634 124536, 123564: 123456, 124536, 125346, 123564, 125634, 126354 , 123645, 126435 , 124365 It can be seen by inspection that the bolded partheads are not shared between the two sets. Any generated partheads will be listed in the validation readout, with the user-specified parthead(s) highlighted in grey. You should use this to check that Complib is correctly identifying the partheads used in the composition. Non-transposing partheads In some cases, it can be difficult to work out the correct ordering of partheads. There are also some cases in which a generated parthead will not appear in the composition despite being implied by other partheads\u2014for example, a composition might make use of an omit to skip one of the partheads. If this is causing problems, you can specify that a parthead provided to Complib should not be used to generate additional partheads. This is done by putting a plus (+) at the front of the parthead. Example: 13425678, +12436578 Normally, the partheads 13425678 and 12436578 together would generate a set of six partheads. However, if the second of these is made a non-transposing parthead, +12436578, then the set generated is: 13425678, 14235678, 12345678, 12436578 It can be seen that 13425678 has only been used to transpose itself, and that 12436578 has been left as-is. Partheads and mid-lead starts/finishes It is important that the partheads provided to Complib are the actual partheads of the composition. Particular care should be taken when a multipart composition uses a mid-lead start/finish, such as in many multipart compositions of Stedman. In such compositions, the parthead rows typically occur in the middle of a lead/division \u2014they are not simply the nearest lead- or section-end, as is sometimes used for convenience when writing a composition down by hand. Example: Multipart beginning at the backstroke snap 5056 Bristol Surprise Major , Op. 3 (rotated) by Alan G Reading is a two-part composition of Bristol Surprise Major which begins at the backstroke snap, or row 2 in the lead. The leadhead row closest to the partend is 12437586, but the true parthead, 12435678, occurs two changes later. It is this true parthead which the composition must specify. By opening a clone of the composition (NB: must be logged in) we can see that 12435678 is indeed the parthead used. Parthead warnings and errors Error: must be a valid row of the same length as the stage This error is encountered if any parthead is an invalid row , or if the stage of the composition and the stage of the specified parthead(s) do not match. Valid row A valid row contains the numbers 1 to N , where N is determined by the specified stage . It must contain each number exactly once . Too many/too few commas If the stages match and the partheads are all valid rows, but you are still seeing the error, it may be because the Parthead(s) field contains too many or too few commas. Specified partheads must be separated by commas, or Complib will interpret them as being part of the same row. Extra commas will prompt Complib to expect additional parthead(s): if it cannot find any, it will interpret this as a parthead of stage zero, which will not match the specified stage. Error: The number of partheads specified is ___ but the composition as pricked only contains ___ of them. Complib will check whether all generated partheads are included among the pricked rows of the composition. If any are missing, then there is a mismatch between the implied multi-part structure and the actual composition. There are two main causes for this error: Incorrect calling There is a mistake in the specified calling which is preventing the composition from reaching an implied parthead; Incorrect parthead(s) The partheads are all valid rows, but one or more of them have been entered incorrectly. As a consequence, the generated parthead(s) do not match the intended ones. You should check that any partheads entered in this field exactly match the expected partheads of the composition. If the number of generated partheads in the validation readout does not match the number of parts you expect the composition to have, then this is a sign that one or more of them has been entered incorrectly. Coursehead mask(s) This field allows you to specify coursehead masks, which are used by Complib when formatting the composition's layout . Coursehead masks should be at the same stage as the composition, and must be separated by commas ( , ). What are courseheads? A coursehead is a starting row of a lead/division which is also the first row of a course. When a composition is laid out by courses , the courseheads will be displayed in the leftmost column (provided Columns > Coursehead is enabled in the composition layout options): When the composition is laid out by leads and Rows > Show all leadheads is enabled, horizontal lines are ruled under each coursehead: Most of the time, Complib is able to infer the intended courseheads. However, if your composition uses unusual courseheads, or courses of non-standard lengths, you may need to specify the courseheads you want displayed. Warning If your composition specifies call positions by a number of leads after the course end, Complib needs to have courseheads provided to it in order to count the leads properly. Additionally, if a composition has multiple parts, you must remember to provide appropriate coursehead masks for all the parts . Manually specifying all courseheads in a composition can be time-consuming and prone to mistakes. To avoid this, Complib allows you to use row masks . What is a row mask? A row mask takes the form of a valid row at the composition's specified stage . However, unlike a normal row, a mask can include wildcards which represent any bell not named elsewhere in the row. Wildcards are denoted with an x in place of a bell number. Examples The following table gives some examples of row masks, together with the rows which match them. Row mask Matching rows Total matches 54321 54321 1 1xxx56 1 234 56, 1 324 56, 1 342 56, 1 432 56, 1 423 56, 1 243 56 6 xxxx2468 1357 2468, 3157 2468, 3517 2468, ... , 7531 2468 24 xxxxxx7890E 123456 7890E, 213456 7890E, ... , 654321 7890E 720 It can be seen that row masks are an efficient way of specifying a large number of potential rows at once. A mask with n wildcards matches n! different rows. How Complib selects courseheads A row will be selected as a coursehead and included in the composition layout if the following hold: The row belongs to any course reached during the composition; and The row is a leadhead; and The row matches any of the specified coursehead masks. If a coursehead satisfies these conditions but is not actually rung during the course to which it belongs, it will be included in the layout (in parentheses). Default coursehead masks All compositions must have at least one coursehead mask. If you do not provide one, Complib will automatically infer a coursehead mask based on the composition's specified stage . The default coursehead mask will generally be of the form x...xN, where N is the largest numbered bell at the composition's specified stage. Missing courseheads If there are courses in the composition which do not contain rows matching any coursehead mask, then: The course will be displayed without a coursehead (for compositions laid out by courses ); No horizontal line will be drawn underneath that course (for compositions laid out by leads with Rows > Show all leadheads enabled). Coursehead mask warnings and errors Error: must be a valid row mask of the same length as the stage. This error is encountered if any coursehead mask is an invalid row mask , or if the stage of the composition and the stage of a coursehead mask do not match. Valid row mask A valid row mask contains exactly N characters, where N is determined by the composition's specified stage . The row mask must contain the numbers 1 to N at most once , with any missing numbers replaced by wildcards ( x ). Too many/too few commas If the stages match and the coursehead masks are all valid, but you are still seeing the error, it may be because the Coursehead mask(s) field contains too many or too few commas. Coursehead masks must be separated by commas, otherwise Complib will interpret them as being part of the same mask. Extra commas will prompt Complib to expect additional coursehead mask(s): if it cannot find any, it will interpret this as a coursehead mask of stage zero, which will not match the specified stage. Start row number Allows you to define which row of the first method's lead/division the composition starts from. Most compositions are rung starting from row 0. If no start row number is specified, the field defaults to a value of 0. If the start row number is anything other than 0, the starting row will be noted underneath the calling in the composition layout . The exceptions are compositions which begin at the treble's backstroke snap , and certain compositions of Stedman . Starting at the backstroke snap A large proportion of compositions with a non-zero starting row are compositions of treble-dodging methods which begin from the treble's backstroke snap . The example below shows the first few rows of Kent Treble Bob Minor , with the backstroke snap labelled. If a composition begins with a treble-dodging method, and has a starting row number of 2, then \"Start at the backstroke snap\" will be appended to the composition layout. Starting rows in compositions of Stedman For historical reasons, touches of Stedman at any stage are usually rung starting from row 4 . For this reason, compositions of Stedman starting from row 4 do not have a starting row appended to their layouts. When a starting row is appended to the layout of a composition of Stedman, it will have a unique format: \"Start with rounds as the [...] row of a [slow/quick] six.\" Starting row warnings and errors Error: ___ must be a positive integer or zero (the default) Starting row numbers must be greater than or equal to zero. If you encounter this error, it is because you have entered a number which is negative (for whatever reason). Error: A method definition's length, its start row number and/or the composition start row number are out of bounds of the method's place notation. This error can be caused by setting a starting row number which is larger than the lead length of the starting method. If changing the starting row number does not clear the error, it may be because a method has been incorrectly configured in the Methods tab . Backstroke start While most compositions are started at handstroke, some compositions are designed to be started at backstroke. You should enable this field if you want to indicate that your custom composition is to be started at backstroke. When enabled, a supplementary note will be added to the composition's layout which reads \"Start at backstroke.\" Any additional instructions relating to how the composition starts (such as a specific starting row ) will be appended to this. Warning Forgetting to set this option may result in the composition's blue line being displayed incorrectly when Column display > Show handstroke/backstroke is enabled. Similarly, stroke-specific properties of the composition such as Changes > Tenors reversed may not be listed accurately. It may also lead to errors in the calculated Music score , e.g. when accounting for handstroke and backstroke wraps, or when using a half-muffled music scheme (see Music schemes for more on this). For the benefit of conductors who might want to ring your composition, please remember to set this option if appropriate! Extents This field is used to signal to Complib the number of complete and partial extents the composition contains. If this field is left blank, Complib will infer the number of extents from the composition's Title and Stage if it can. Otherwise, it will default to a value of 1. Complib uses the Extents value to determine how many times the composition is expected to return to rounds, as well as the maximum allowable repetitions of a given row before the composition runs false. If the Extents value is set too small, there may sections of the composition which are ignored because the composition comes round before that point is reached, or because the maximum number of false rows is been reached. Default calls This field is a dropdown menu, from which you can select a default call type for the composition. This will determine the way that standard call symbols such as - and s are interpreted in the composition's calling . It will also determine the default behaviour of entries in the Calls tab . This field may autofill with a certain value depending on which calling positions have been used in the composition's Calling tab , and which method is defined in the Methods tab . The default call types are: Near Calls will default towards the front of the change. Standard bobs and singles will be assumed to be 4ths-place calls unless otherwise specified in the Calls tab. Far Calls will default towards the back of the change. Standard bobs and singles will be assumed to be ( N -2)ths-place calls unless otherwise specified in the Calls tab. Grandsire Calls will be assumed to represent Grandsire-type calls appropriate to the composition's stage. This call type is normally only used in compositions of twin-hunt methods such as Grandsire and Single Oxford, or in Doubles variations like April Day. Stedman Calls will be assumed to represent Stedman-type calls appropriate to the composition's stage. This call type is normally only used in compositions of Stedman and Erin. None Calls will not default to any particular type. If this call type is selected, then all calls used in the calling must be manually defined in the Calls tab. You should use this call type to signal to the conductor that the composition uses calls which fall outside any of the standard types. Notes This field allows you to provide additional notes to accompany the composition. For instance, this could be a piece of historical information, some interesting feature of the composition, or your favourite recipe for parsnip soup. The text entered in this field will be displayed in the Library details tab on the composition's page. Notes: Things to bear in mind It is unnecessary to include certain things in the notes which might be common in other printed or online collections, such as special calls, calling alterations, truth to other methods and musical features. Complib derives and displays all this information automatically. The notes field has a character limit of 1000. Entries longer than this will be truncated. Allow save if false The vast majority of compositions that change ringers use are true (i.e., not false). See Composition properties > Truth for an explanation of what it means for a composition to be true. By default, Complib will not allow you to save or publish a composition which is false. Enabling this option will override that behaviour, allowing a false composition to be saved and potentially published. There are a number of reasons you might want to save a false composition. For example, some compositions are of historical note, having been used in performances which were only subsequently discovered to be false. Short touches used for practice are usually not held to the same standard as performances, but are still valid and useful compositions in and of themselves. Being able to save a work-in-progress so that you can come back to it later, regardless of falseness, is useful in cases when debugging a complex composition, or when testing out new ideas. A false composition will be indicated with a next to its title on its composition page and in search results.","title":"General tab"},{"location":"compositions/adding_compositions_tabs_general/#the-general-tab","text":"The General tab allows you to specify various high-level properties of a custom composition.

In a composition that has multiple parts, a parthead is the first row of one of the parts. Partheads must be valid rows, and must match the currently specified stage . If more than one parthead is entered, they must be separated by commas ( , ). Complib will use any specified partheads to generate a set of partheads. The size of this set depends on the partheads themselves, as well as the order in which they are entered. Specifically, Complib generates the set of partheads by repeatedly transposing any defined parthead by itself, and by any which were defined before it. Example: Parthead 135264 Suppose that your composition uses the parthead 135264. Complib will repeatedly apply the transposition implied by this parthead to obtain the additional partheads 156342, 164523 and 142635. These generated partheads do not themselves generate any new partheads, so these four partheads (together with rounds) form a closed set. Example: Partheads 123465, 123645 Partheads 123465 and 123645 together will generate a set of six partheads: 123465, 123645, 123546, 123654, 123564 and 123456. The same set will be generated regardless of the ordering of the two specified partheads. It is important to bear in mind that the ordering of the custom partheads can change the resulting set of generated partheads. The next example demonstrates this. Example: Partheads 123564, 124536 The two partheads 123564 and 124536 will produce a total of nine generated partheads. However, the members of those sets depends on which order the two given partheads are specified in. 123564, 124536: 123456, 123564, 123645, 124536, 124365, 124653 , 125346, 125463 , 125634 124536, 123564: 123456, 124536, 125346, 123564, 125634, 126354 , 123645, 126435 , 124365 It can be seen by inspection that the bolded partheads are not shared between the two sets.

If this is causing problems, you can specify that a parthead provided to Complib should not be used to generate additional partheads. This is done by putting a plus (+) at the front of the parthead.

Every composition must have at least one method definition. To edit any value in the table, simply click on the relevant cell, then type a new value. Multiple cells can be highlighted by clicking and dragging. Alternatively, you can click on a cell, hold Shift , and then click on another cell to highlight a rectangle with those cells at opposite corners. If you have filled out the Title field under the General tab , then the Methods tab may already be populated with one or more entries. Method title To manually add methods to the table, begin typing its title in the Method title column. As you type, Complib will attempt to auto-complete with the titles of any matching public methods, or private methods which you own. Once a recognised method title has been entered, the rest of the cells in the row will auto-populate with default values appropriate to that method. Deleting methods Deleting a method's name in the table will delete all its associated information as well. Warning: Replacing methods It is best practice to delete a method from the table before replacing it with another, instead of simply changing the method name. Changing the name will not automatically update the rest of the table to match the default entries for the new method. This can result in peculiar behaviour, e.g. a treble-dodging method with the Length of a plain method, or vice versa. Adding methods from a collection You can add methods directly from an existing method collection. This can be useful if you need to add a large number of methods to the tab. To add methods from a collection, click on the dropdown menu above the methods table, then click on a method collection. The table will be populated with all the methods in that collection. It's possible to add methods from multiple collections in this way, though the methods must all be at the same stage for this to work. Methods already in the table will not be duplicated if they are added again via collection. If you want multiple copies of a method, you must add them manually. Mnemonic A method mnemonic is a one- or two-character code which is used to represent the method in the composition's layout . Mnemonics are displayed by default in compositions of spliced, but they can be enabled for any composition by selecting Columns > Method mnemonics in the composition layout options . Mnemonic restrictions Method mnemonics must have an uppercase letter [A\u2013Z] as their first character. This may be optionally followed by a lowercase letter [a\u2013z] or number [0\u20139]. Method mnemonics must be unique. If two methods used in a composition have the same mnemonic, it will cause an error. Default mnemonics When a method is added to the Methods tab, its mnemonic will be the first letter in its title by default. Any numbers and special characters at the beginning of the title will be ignored. For example, 'ogwash Delight Minor has a default mnemonic of \"O\". Deleting a method's mnemonic from the table will reset the mnemonic to its default value. If a method is given a mnemonic which is different from its default in a composition of spliced, then the mnemonic will be appended to the method's name at the bottom of the composition layout. Starting place This field defines the row position above which the changes of the method will be applied. In effect, this defines where the \"front\" of the change is when ringing the specified method. Bells in positions which fall outside the bounds of the method will remain stationary whenever the method is rung in the composition. Example These examples show the first half-lead of Bristol Surprise Major being rung on 10 bells, but with different starting places. Since the method's stage has 8 bells, there are two stationary bells. Warning It is highly unlikely that you will ever need to adjust the Starting place value; it is currently only used in extremely rare types of composition.. In fact, it is strongly recommended that you leave this value at 1 at all times. Warning: [Method name] ( __ ) - Stage is higher than the composition's stage with a starting place of __ . The starting place cannot cause the method to go outside the bounds of the composition's stage. The minimum starting place is 1. The maximum starting place is ( N \u2013 M + 1), where N is the stage of the composition and M is the stage of the method. This means that it is only possible for a method to have a starting place greater than 1 when used in a composition whose stage is greater than its own, such as in mixed-stage compositions . Rotate by This field specifies an amount by which the method's changes will be rotated. When Complib pricks (generates the rows of) a composition, it does so by sequentially applying the changes of the method as specified in its place notation . By default, the pricker will start every lead from the first change of the method, given by the first element of the place notation. When it reaches the end, it will start again from the beginning, provided there is no change of method. When a Rotate by value is specified, that many changes and their the corresponding place notation elements will be removed from the start of the lead and reinserted at the end. This modified set of changes has become the definition of a lead of the method within the composition, and the final change is the new leadend change. Example Below are the plain courses of two different rotations of Double Court Bob Minor , together with their place notations. Lines are drawn through bell number 2, as well as the hunt bell in each case. Rotate by = 0 -14-36-16-36-14-16 Rotate by = 5 16-36-14-16-14-36- Rotate by: restrictions The Rotate by value must be between 0 and ( L \u2013 1), where L is the lead length of the method. Attempting to specify a Rotate by value that falls outside this range will cause an error. The lead length of a method is listed under the Properties tab on its Method page (see Method properties > Miscellaneous ). Start row number This field specifies which row of the method it should be started from. The default value is 0. Almost all methods are rung with a starting row of 0. When a Start row number is specified, that many changes will be removed from the front of the first lead of the method. The removed changes are not reinserted elsewhere, and the leadend change remains the same. The changes in subsequent (consecutive) leads of the method are not affected. Whenenever a change-of-method results in this method being rung, this operation is applied again. Example The above diagram shows part of a composition of Double Norwich Court Bob Major in which the method's Start row number has been set to 4. Four changes have been removed from the first lead, resulting in a lead which is four rows shorter. Rotate by vs. Start row number The effects of a method's Start row number on the actual rows of the composition are, in some cases, identical to that of the Rotate by field. The main difference is in which rows of the method will be treated as leadheads and courseheads when laying out the composition. Example In this example, a plain course of Grandsire Triples is being rung with a Start row number of 4. In a blue line diagram, the rows which Complib considers leadheads have horizontal lines drawn above them by default. For coursehead rows, the lines are blue. When laid out by leads, the layout for this composition looks like this: A touch containing identical rows can be defined using a rotation instead. However, the appearance of the composition will be different. If instead the Rotate by value is set to 4, the blue line diagram becomes: And the corresponding layout: Warning A method's Start row number should not be confused with the composition's Start row number , which is set under the General tab. The difference is that a method's Start row number is part of its definition, and will combine with other parts of the method's definition (such as Length and Lead position row number ) to determine how every lead of it in the composition is rung. By contrast, a composition's Start row number affects only the first lead of the composition, and has no bearing on a method's definition. If both a method and the composition's Start row numbers are non-zero, then their effects may be combined. This can have unintended consequences. In almost all cases, it is only necessary to set one of them. Length This value specifies how many changes are in each lead of the method. Whenever a lead of the method is reached in the composition, Complib will apply the method's changes in sequence until the number of rows in the lead is equal to the Length value. By default, this value will be equal to the method's Lead length , which can be found under the Properties tab on its method page. Warning: [Method name] ( __ ) - The defined length ( __ ) is greater than its lead length ( __ ). You should in almost all circumstances avoid using a Length value greater than the lead length of the method, as it can cause unnecessary confusion. If you want to have a partial lead of a method, there are multiple ways of achieving the same effect: You can define a special call, called a trim , which removes a number of changes from a lead of the method. See Calls for help with using trims. You can define a second instance of the same method in the Methods table with a Length that is less than its Lead length. If so, you will need to give this instance a unique method mnemonic , and indicate a change-of-method at the appropriate place in the Calling . Error: [Method name] ( __ ) - Length must be greater than zero. Self-explanatory. Lead position row number and name These two values together define the location and name of a Lead position . Lead position A position within a lead of the method where a call can be applied. The Lead position row number is the number of the row to which a call's change is applied, or to which the final change of the call is applied, if it has more than one. Example: Cambridge S Minor with a halflead call In this (rather contrived) example, an unusual call with place notation 12.36 is made at the half-lead of Cambridge Surprise Minor . The call affects rows number 11 and 12 in the lead. The Lead position row number for the call is therefore 12. The highlighted elements of the place notation are the ones caused by the call. The final change of the call affects row number 12, which has been marked in red. By default, the Lead position row number will be equal to the method's Length value, since most calls occur at the end of a lead. The Lead position name is an identifier which is used to refer to this Lead position in places such as a call definition , and in the composition layout . The Lead position name can be any string of characters you like: you can even use emoji or other special symbols. The only requirement is that it must exactly match the name you use for that position in the Calls tab . The Lead position name will be included at the bottom of the composition layout as part of a call's definition. This means that, for example, the Lead position name can be used to name calls used in Doubles variations. Example: Plain Bob with a Pink's Single By naming the lead position \" Pink's \" in an an extent of Plain Bob Doubles with an appropriate call definition , you get the variation May Day Doubles with the layout showing the call as: s = 145.345.123.345.145 Pink's Single . Defining multiple Lead positions It's possible to define multiple different Lead positions for the same method. To do this, enter a new Lead position row number and name in the table row beneath the original method definition. The rest of the row should be left blank. Default Lead positions Every method has a Lead position which Complib uses for it by default. Unlike custom Lead position names, default Lead position names will not be given in the composition's layout. The default name and row number used depends on the method's type. LE Short for \"lead end\". This is the default Lead position for methods which are hunters (see Method properties > Hunt bells ). The default position is the final row of the lead. SE Short for \"section end\". This is the default Lead position for principles , which are methods with no hunt bells. The default row number is 1, the first row of the lead.","title":"Methods tab"},{"location":"compositions/adding_compositions_tabs_methods/#the-methods-tab","text":"The Methods tab is a table which allows you to define the methods which are used in a custom composition.

In almost all cases, it is only necessary to set one of them.","title":"Rotate by vs. Start row number"},{"location":"compositions/adding_compositions_tabs_methods/#length","text":"This value specifies how many changes are in each lead of the method. Whenever a lead of the method is reached in the composition, Complib will apply the method's changes in sequence until the number of rows in the lead is equal to the Length value. By default, this value will be equal to the method's Lead length , which can be found under the Properties tab on its method page. Warning: [Method name] ( __ ) - The defined length ( __ ) is greater than its lead length ( __ ). You should in almost all circumstances avoid using a Length value greater than the lead length of the method, as it can cause unnecessary confusion. If you want to have a partial lead of a method, there are multiple ways of achieving the same effect: You can define a special call, called a trim , which removes a number of changes from a lead of the method. See Calls for help with using trims. You can define a second instance of the same method in the Methods table with a Length that is less than its Lead length. If so, you will need to give this instance a unique method mnemonic , and indicate a change-of-method at the appropriate place in the Calling .

Lead position A position within a lead of the method where a call can be applied. The Lead position row number is the number of the row to which a call's change is applied, or to which the final change of the call is applied, if it has more than one. Example: Cambridge S Minor with a halflead call In this (rather contrived) example, an unusual call with place notation 12.36 is made at the half-lead of Cambridge Surprise Minor . The call affects rows number 11 and 12 in the lead. The Lead position row number for the call is therefore 12. The highlighted elements of the place notation are the ones caused by the call. The final change of the call affects row number 12, which has been marked in red. By default, the Lead position row number will be equal to the method's Length value, since most calls occur at the end of a lead. The Lead position name is an identifier which is used to refer to this Lead position in places such as a call definition , and in the composition layout . The Lead position name can be any string of characters you like: you can even use emoji or other special symbols. The only requirement is that it must exactly match the name you use for that position in the Calls tab . The Lead position name will be included at the bottom of the composition layout as part of a call's definition. This means that, for example, the Lead position name can be used to name calls used in Doubles variations. Example: Plain Bob with a Pink's Single By naming the lead position \" Pink's \" in an an extent of Plain Bob Doubles with an appropriate call definition , you get the variation May Day Doubles with the layout showing the call as: s = 145.345.123.345.145 Pink's Single .","title":"Lead position row number and name"},{"location":"compositions/adding_compositions_tabs_methods/#defining-multiple-lead-positions","text":"It's possible to define multiple different Lead positions for the same method.

These properties are listed in the composition page's Properties tab . The Properties tab When expanded, the top of the tab shows a number of checkboxes, each of which corresponds to a different potential feature of the composition. These properties are arranged into a number of groups. Structure Backstroke start The vast majority of compositions are designed to be started at handstroke. If the composition is designed to be started at backstroke instead, it will be indicated here. Mid lead start The composition begins at a point other than the beginning of a lead/division. Mid lead finish The composition finishes at a point other than the end of a lead/division. Variable hunt There is a change of principal hunt bell(s) at any point during the composition. Note: Strictness of variable hunt This condition is strict: any composition in which the principle hunt bell does anything other the work of the hunt bell at any point will be classified as variable hunt. This includes otherwise ordinary compositions involving a \"funny start\" in which the hunt bell does the work of another bell for a few changes before spending the rest of the touch as the hunt bell. Whether a composition is variable hunt affects how its all the work property is determined (see below). Variable cover There is a change of cover bell(s) during the composition. Note: Variable cover and stage In compositions which are variable cover, the stage of the composition is higher than that of the method(s) in which the change of cover occurs. This is because the stage of the composition must include the cover bell(s), which is usually ignored when determining a method's stage. Methods Spliced The composition involves multiple methods. ATW The composition is \"all the work\", meaning that all working bells ring every place bell of every method in the composition at least once. If a composition is not all the work, a note to this effect will appear at the bottom of its layout . A breakdown of a composition's ATW status can be viewed in its ATW analysis tab . Note: ATW for variable hunt, variable cover and mixed stage compositions ATW is assessed differently depending on whether a composition is variable hunt or variable cover , or for compositions which are mixed stage . Variable hunt If a composition is variable hunt, then all bells must do the work of both the working bells and the hunt bells in every method . This is true even if the hunt bell path is the same in all methods. For example, in an variable hunt composition of Spliced Surprise Major which is ATW, all eight bells must ring every place bell in each method, and in addition they must ring the treble path in at least one lead of each method. Variable cover If a composition is variable cover, all bells must ring all place bells and do the work of the cover bell(s) in each method to be considered ATW. Mixed stage If a composition is mixed stage, and if the heaviest bell is always a cover bell in a method at the lower stage, then the cover bell is ignored for the purposes of determining ATW in that method. Mixed stage The composition includes methods at different stages (e.g. Triples and Major). Change every lead There is a change of method at the end of every lead in the composition (for compositions of spliced). Every lead different No working bell ever repeats a place bell of any method in the composition. Jump method The composition includes one or more methods which have jump changes . Calls Standard calls The composition uses calls belonging to one, and only one, of the standard call types . These are: Near calls : Fourth's place bobs and singles; Far calls : n-2's place bobs and singles; Grandsire : Grandsire-type calls; Stedman : Stedman-type calls. A composition using multiple different standard call types will not be listed as using standard calls. Twin bob The composition exclusively uses pairs of bobs at S, L, Q and/or H (for compositions of Stedman Triples ). Jump calls The composition includes calls which cause jump changes. No calls The composition does not include any calls. Tenors together The tenors (the two largest numbered bells in compositions of Minor, Triples and Major; bells 7 and above at higher stages) are in their home positions at each course end in the composition. Strictly tenors together The relative positions of the tenors (the two largest numbered bells in compositions of Minor, Triples and Major; bells 7 and above at higher stages) within the coursing order are unaffected by all calls. Multipart calling The composition is expressed as a number of repeated parts (with potential alterations in some parts). Changes Adjacent changes The composition includes at least one adjacent change . An adjacent change is a non-identity change in which every bell moves at most one position between rows. Identity changes The composition includes at least one identity change . An identity change is a change where all bells remain in the same position between rows. Jump changes The composition includes at least one jump change . A jump change is a change in which at least one bell moves more than one position between rows. Tenors reversed The composition includes at least one instance in which the two heaviest bells strike in reverse order at backstroke. Palindromic There is at least one point within the composition about which it is palindromic. The changes of the composition when read in either direction from such a point are indistinguishable. Exact multipart The composition can be expressed as two or more repeated blocks, all of which have identical changes. Truth For a full explanation of the terms used in the following definitions, see Section 3 (J) of the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing. True A composition is true if: It includes zero or more complete extents at its effective stage ; and Any rows not part of a complete extent occur exactly once. Warning: False compositions Compositions which are not true are said to be false . While false compositions can be published on the Composition Library, they will be excluded from most searches, and performances using them will not be qualifying performances for the purposes of method naming, peal records, etc. The majority of false compositions included in the Composition Library are either: Compositions which were discovered to be false after they were performed, but which have been kept for historical reference; Touches intended exclusively for practice. False compositions are identified with a cross next to their titles wherever they appear in the Composition Library. Round block The composition begins and ends at the same row. The Composition Library currently cannot accept compositions which are not round blocks. Single extent block The rows of the composition comprise a single complete extent at its effective stage. Multi-extent block The rows of the composition comprise exactly two or more complete extents at its effective stage. Repetition between calls The composition has one or more instances in which a row is repeated without a call or change of method being made in between. Any composition with this property will be identified with a supplementary note at the bottom of the composition layout. Internal rounds The composition has one or more instances in which rounds occurs somewhere other than the last row of a complete extent (not including the first/last row of the composition). Miscellaneous In addition to the above, the properties tab also lists miscellaneous information about the composition in text form. The listed items are: Number of parts The number of repeated parts comprising the composition. Number of methods The number of distinct methods included in the composition's definition. Changes of method The number of times that the method changes during the composition. Note: Repeated method definitions If the same method is defined more than once under the Methods tab with different mnemonics, then any interruption to the method's changes will also count as a change of method. For example, a composition which restarts the lead of a method partway through a lead of that same method will have a change of method recorded at that point (e.g. 1440 Lincoln Surprise Minor arr. Michael E Ovenden). Changes of method which come about in this way are noted in the composition's Properties tab, but they will not be displayed in the composition's layout . Warning: Implied changes of method Change of method does not include any \"implied\" changes of method between the final and starting methods of a round block. A performance which comprises multiple repetitions of such a round block will therefore have additional changes of method not accounted for here. Stage The name of the stage of the composition. For mixed stage compositions, this is the name of the highest-numbered stage. See Section 3A of the Central Council Framework for an explanation of stages and their names. True rows The number of true rows in the composition. For true compositions, this will be equal to the length of the touch. For false compositions, this will be the length of the touch after subtracting any false rows (see below). False rows The number of false rows in the composition. A row X is false if: X is a repetition of a previously rung row (call it Y); AND Neither X nor Y form part of a complete extent. Complete extents The number of complete extents at the effective stage of the composition. Partial extents The number of incomplete, or partial extents at the effective stage of the composition. For a composition which is true , this number will always be either 0 or 1. Applicable leadhead codes The leadhead code(s) of methods for which the composition could potentially be used. For a detailed explanation of leadhead codes and their definitions, see Appendix C of the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing. Warning: Limitations of Applicable leadhead codes Complib currently does not derive this information from the properties of a composition. Instead, when a composition is added to the Composition Library, an internal extended search is performed against all methods at the composition's stage. If a method is true to the composition, its leadhead code is added to the list of Applicable leadhead codes. Because of this, it is not necessarily true that a composition's Applicable leadhead codes include all leadhead codes which might be true to it. In particular, a usable leadhead code may be missing if: A new method was added to Complib after the composition; and That method is true to the composition; and That method's leadhead code is not already represented in the composition's Applicable leadhead codes. Date composed The date the composition was composed (if specified). Default calls The default call type in the composition's definition. This determines what the standard calls (usually bobs - and singles s ) represent in the composition. The named call types that the Composition Library uses are: Near : calls default toward the front of the change (e.g. 4ths place bobs). Far : calls default toward the back of the change (e.g. n-2's place bobs). Grandsire : the composition uses Grandsire-type calls. Stedman : the composition uses Stedman-type calls. None : the composition has no specified call type. Types of call The number of different call types used in the composition.

Changes of method The number of times that the method changes during the composition. Note: Repeated method definitions If the same method is defined more than once under the Methods tab with different mnemonics, then any interruption to the method's changes will also count as a change of method. For example, a composition which restarts the lead of a method partway through a lead of that same method will have a change of method recorded at that point (e.g. 1440 Lincoln Surprise Minor arr. Michael E Ovenden). Changes of method which come about in this way are noted in the composition's Properties tab, but they will not be displayed in the composition's layout . Warning: Implied changes of method Change of method does not include any \"implied\" changes of method between the final and starting methods of a round block. A performance which comprises multiple repetitions of such a round block will therefore have additional changes of method not accounted for here. Stage The name of the stage of the composition. For mixed stage compositions, this is the name of the highest-numbered stage. See Section 3A of the Central Council Framework for an explanation of stages and their names. True rows The number of true rows in the composition. For true compositions, this will be equal to the length of the touch. For false compositions, this will be the length of the touch after subtracting any false rows (see below). False rows The number of false rows in the composition. A row X is false if: X is a repetition of a previously rung row (call it Y); AND Neither X nor Y form part of a complete extent. Complete extents The number of complete extents at the effective stage of the composition. Partial extents The number of incomplete, or partial extents at the effective stage of the composition. For a composition which is true , this number will always be either 0 or 1. Applicable leadhead codes The leadhead code(s) of methods for which the composition could potentially be used. For a detailed explanation of leadhead codes and their definitions, see Appendix C of the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing. Warning: Limitations of Applicable leadhead codes Complib currently does not derive this information from the properties of a composition. Instead, when a composition is added to the Composition Library, an internal extended search is performed against all methods at the composition's stage. If a method is true to the composition, its leadhead code is added to the list of Applicable leadhead codes. Because of this, it is not necessarily true that a composition's Applicable leadhead codes include all leadhead codes which might be true to it. In particular, a usable leadhead code may be missing if: A new method was added to Complib after the composition; and That method is true to the composition; and That method's leadhead code is not already represented in the composition's Applicable leadhead codes. Date composed The date the composition was composed (if specified). Default calls The default call type in the composition's definition. This determines what the standard calls (usually bobs - and singles s ) represent in the composition. The named call types that the Composition Library uses are: Near : calls default toward the front of the change (e.g. 4ths place bobs). Far : calls default toward the back of the change (e.g. n-2's place bobs). Grandsire : the composition uses Grandsire-type calls. Stedman : the composition uses Stedman-type calls. None : the composition has no specified call type. Types of call The number of different call types used in the composition. The number of times that each different call type occurs is also listed.","title":"Miscellaneous"},{"location":"compositions/layout_options/","text":"Customising composition layouts The composition layout options menu can be accessed by clicking the cog button at the top right of a composition page's Layout tab .

These derive from the main ways in which compositions have historically been notated. By courses In this format, courses are given in separate rows, and calls are listed in columns which specify calling positions . By leads In this format, the number of leads between each call are listed in a column. Additional columns give information such as the call types, calling positions, and the leadheads which result from each call. In the following sections, layout options which are specific to one of these formats will be noted.

In the most general terms, a composition is a specified calling for a change ringing performance. A composition is stored in Complib as this calling, together with specified method(s) for which it has been designed. Complib automatically pricks (generates the rows of) any composition when it is entered in order to establish its truth . Stored compositions are then given their own dedicated pages, which might look something like this: At the top of the page is the composition's user-defined title , and its star rating . The star rating displays a weighted average of any submitted ratings by registered users. Toolbar To the right of the composition title and rating is the toolbar : The toolbar buttons can be identified by hovering over them. Some of the toolbar buttons may not be visible on every method page , or to every user. The buttons are, from left to right: Find methods true to this Begins an extended search of methods in the Composition Library to determine which ones are true to this composition. This search will include any private methods you have defined. Only available to registered Power Users. Add to collection Adds the composition to a collection of your choice. Publish Publishes the composition to the Public library. Only available to registered users, for private compositions which you own. Clone Creates a duplicate of the composition on the Add composition page, which you can then edit (see Creating a new composition ). Only available to registered users. Edit Opens the composition in the composition editor . Only available to registered users, when viewing a composition which you created. Share Displays a public link to the composition page so it can be shared with others. Note The composition will be visible via the link regardless of whether the composition itself is public . This is useful if you want to share a composition without publishing it. See Creating a new composition > Publishing compositions for more information on what it means for a composition to be public or private. Export rows Opens a new browser tab containing the pricked rows of the composition in plaintext form. Printable version Opens a new browser tab which displays the human-readable layout of the composition in a form that's easy to print. Its appearance is determined by the currently configured composition layout options . Tabs overview A composition page is subdivided into various expandable tabs (click on the name of a tab to skip to a detailed description of its contents): Layout The human-readable form of the composition. The appearance of this can be adjusted using the composition layout options . Blue Line The pricked rows of the composition, with (or without) an overlaid blue line. The appearance of this can be adjusted using the blue line display options . Music Score The music score breakdown of the composition with respect to a specified music scheme . Users can use one of the default schemes (such as for half-muffled ringing), or specify their own. Handbell Positions Information about which positions each handbell pair rings during the composition, including the number of leads rung and their relative frequency. Properties The technical features of the composition, such as its length , number of parts , whether it is all-the-work , and more. ATW Analysis A comprehensive analysis of the all-the-work property for every method included in the composition. Related Compositions A list of all compositions which are related to the current one, i.e., because they are related by some transformation such as rotation or reversal, or because they have the same calling but different specified methods. Performances Historical information about occasions when the composition has been performed, with links to the relevant Bellboard page. References A list of all accessible collections containing the current composition. If you own a private collection containing the composition, it will be included here. Library Details Information about to the composition's Complib entry, including which library it is contained in, its Composition Id , any Notes included by the publisher, etc. Layout This tab gives the calling for the composition in human-readable form. With default settings, the layout should look something like this: Generated title The composition's generated title is given automatically by Complib, and may differ from its user-defined title. The generated title specifies, in order: the length of the composition; (if a single-method composition) the title of the method it is defined for; or (if a spliced composition) the number of methods , their common class (if it exists) and stage(s) ; the opus number and name (if it exists). Attribution If the composition has been attributed to anyone, it will be noted here. Usually this will be the name of the composer(s) or arranger(s). Calling The calls which make up the composition, together with any supplementary information , including: Number of parts (for multipart compositions); Modifications to the calling (e.g., calls or methods which change in certain parts); The observation bell , for compositions in which it is not the highest numbered bell; Turning course definitions ; Non-standard starts (e.g., for compositions beginning at backstroke, or at a point other than the start of a lead/division); Non-standard or user-defined calls : these will be defined in words (e.g. Far, Near, Grandsire) or using place notation . Method details For spliced compositions, the methods rung will be listed here. The readout will give the number of rows of each method in the composition, and their corresponding method mnemonics if disambiguation is needed. Clicking on a method's name will take you to its method page . Music A list of common musical metrics is given for the composition, together with named rows it features such as Queens or Tittums. See also: Music score . Customise layout options Users can adjust the form and style of the layout to suit a wide variety of needs and preferences (see Customising composition layouts ). Layout colour coding Various elements of the composition layout will change colour when displaying a composition which is false. The specific elements which change colour will depend on the format of the layout. Course/leadheads in magenta ( ) indicate that the course/lead contains a row which is false against another row which appears later in the composition. Course/leadheads in red ( ) indicate that either: The course/lead contains a row which is false against another row which appears earlier in the composition; or The course/lead is false against itself. Blue Line When expanded, this tab will render all the rows of the composition in accordance with the configured blue line options . By default, it should look something like this: Much like those for methods, the blue line display for compositions is highly customisable. For an explanation of most of the available options, see Methods > Customising the blue line . There are a number of blue line options which are unique to compositions. These are: Calls : displays calls at the points where they occur. Default: on . Plains : marks plain leads/divisions, similarly to leads with calls. Default: off . Method mnemonics : Displays the method mnemonic of the method currently being rung at the beginning of each lead. Default: on . Warning By default, the blue line tab will attempt to display the entire touch at once. For long lengths, or compositions on higher numbers, the rendering process may take some time. The blue line display will also auto-resize to fit the width of your browser window. For longer compositions on higher numbers, this may result in bell numbers which are very small. In these cases, you may wish to adjust the number of columns or rows which are displayed in the blue line display options . Music Score This tab calculates a numerical score for the composition based on the various metrics, or tests , specified in a music scheme . The table in the tab provides a breakdown of this score: for each applicable test, the number of rows in the composition which satisfy the test is given. The music scheme used to calculate the score can be changed via the dropdown menu at the top right of the tab. Warning If the selected music scheme has no applicable tests which can be scored against, then the Music Score tab will be left empty. Clicking on a test will expand that test further: Most of the tests are self explanatory. For a full description, together with information about how to define your own tests, see Music schemes . Handbell Positions For handbell ringers, it is often useful to know what positions your two bells are in relative to each other. Each handbell pair has a corresponding position (e.g 3-4 position) which is uniquely determined by what that pair does in the plain course . When expanded, the tab displays a table: Down the left hand side of the table is listed each handbell pair. The column headings give the corresponding positions. The table entries specify how long the given handbell pair spends in that position, both as a number of leads and as a percentage of the whole composition. The rightmost column lists the number of distinct leads that each handbell pair rings throughout the composition. This is used to calculate the relative simplicity of the composition for a given handbell pair. For spliced compositions, clicking on the name of the handbell pair will further expand the table to show a breakdown by individual method. Properties For a detailed explanation of the information contained in the properties tab, see the dedicated page on Composition properties . ATW Analysis This tab gives an analysis of the work rung by each bell in each method in the composition. It is often the case that ringers will look for a composition which is \"all the work\", meaning that all working bells ring every place bell of every method. On the other hand, a composition which requires knowledge of only a few leads of a method can be useful for those still learning it. When expanded, the tab will look something like this: Each column represents the grid of one lead of the given method, and gives the analysis for the bell indicated at the top of the column. The numbers in the grid represent the number of times that the specified bell rings in that grid position in the method, over the whole composition . The numbers 1 to 9 in any position denote that many instances of the bell ringing in that position. A greater-than symbol ( > ) in means the bell rings in that position 10 times or more. A red square means the bell never rings in that position. Example The image above shows the first half of the grid of Lessness Surprise Major , as rung in this composition . Bell 1 is the hunt bell, and only ever rings in the positions described by its hunt path. Bells 2 through 6 are do all the work in the given method, because the only positions they do not ring are those occupied by the hunt bell. By contrast, Bells 7 and 8 do not do all the work. Bell 7 never rings 4ths place bell, Bell 8 never rings 3rds place bell, and neither of them ring 2nds place bell. The missing place bells can be identified by the positions of the red squares in the first row of the method. ATW in variable hunt, variable cover and mixed-stage compositions The requirements for ATW may be different depending on whether the composition is variable hunt , variable cover or mixed stage . For an explanation of these terms as well as their effects on the determination of ATW, see Composition Properties . Related Compositions This tab lists any compositions which are related to the current composition (and which you have access to). Each similarity relation is reciprocal: A is related to B in the same way that B is related to A. There are a number of different ways in which two compositions can be related, and they may be related in multiple ways at once. The types of similarity relation are: Rotated calling The two compositions define the same sequence of calls, but beginning at different points. Transposed calling The two compositions have the same sequence of calls, but with the calling positions transposed. Reversed calling The two compositions have callings which are reverses of each other. Identical calling/changes/rows The two compositions have identical callings/changes/rows. Compositions related in these ways are effectively the same, although there may still be good reason to document them separately. Performances This tab lists any performances of the composition which have been submitted. Each entry has three fields: Date The date on which the performance was rung. Type Specifies one of a number of performance types: First rung on towerbells/handbells/etc. : a performance which is recognised as being the first performance of the composition using a particular Ringing Style. [Length] on towerbells/handbells/etc. : A recognised performance of the specified length (Peal, Quarter Peal, etc.) using the composition and the specified Ringing Style. Details The published details of the performance: title, performing Guild or Association (if given), location, and conductor (if given). The entry in this field acts as a link to the corresponding Bellboard performance, provided it exists and has been linked to the composition page. References This tab lists all collections which you have access to and which reference the current composition (inaccessible private collections will not be displayed). Each entry has four fields, with every entry acting as a link to the relevant Complib page: Collection The name of the collection to which the composition belongs. Chapter (optional) The chapter of the composition's entry in the collection (if specified). Page (optional) The page number of the composition's entry in the collection (if specified), or the page number in an external reference. If the reference is to an external source, this entry may be a clickable link to that source. Reference (optional) In the case that the collection is referenced by a certain index, the corresponding reference for the composition within the collection. If the reference is to an external source, this entry may be a clickable link to that source. For more on references and how they relate to collections, see Collections . Library Details This tab lists some of the composition's Complib-specific metadata. Library The library which contains the composition. The only two libraries for compositions are Public and Private . Notes Any notes provided by the compositions's publisher. Composition Id The composition's numerical ID. This is the number featured at the end of a composition page's URL. A Quick search using a Composition Id will navigate directly to that composition's page. Created on The date and time at which the composition was created and the name of the user who created it.

When expanded, the tab will look something like this: Each column represents the grid of one lead of the given method, and gives the analysis for the bell indicated at the top of the column.

A host of conventions have developed over centuries, some of which may not be especially obvious to the uninitiated. This section is intended as an introduction to reading and interpreting compositions as they are commonly encountered, such as in your Ringing World Diary, or on Complib itself. The examples given, while fairly typical, are not a complete representation of all the different kinds of compositions you might encounter. However, understanding them well will equip you to approach a broad spectrum of unfamiliar compositions and figure out how they work for yourself. Callings versus Layouts It's important to remember that a composition is defined by its calling , but not by its layout or style of presentation. The same composition can be represented in many different ways. Indeed, Complib gives users a lot of control over the way that any composition appears to them. Calling formats There are two generally distinct types of format which callings use: those laid out by courses , and those laid out by leads . How you read a composition and derive calling information from it depends on which layout type has been used. Laid out by courses A typical composition laid out by courses may look something like this: Example: 1280 5-Spliced Surprise Major by Robert D S Brown The calling is laid out in a table, which should be read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Each table row represents a course (or a set of courses). Some of the labelled elements may not be present, while others not shown here might be included. Click on the name of an element below to navigate to a section explaining it in more detail. Courseheads The first row of each course (or set of courses) in the touch. Since all compositions begin from rounds, the first coursehead is almost always rounds. By convention, bells which do not change position between courseheads are usually omitted altogether. Calls The calls which, together with the method(s), produce the rows of the composition. Calls are represented by symbols arranged into columns. Calling positions The headings of the columns, which indicate when the calls in that column are made. Most compositions use calling positions with standard meanings which are commonly understood. Method mnemonics Used in compositions of Spliced to indicate changes of method. Each method in the composition is given an alphanumeric code. Each instance of a mnemonic represents one lead of its associated method. It is common to insert periods (or sometimes commas) between mnemonics to indicate where the calls occur. Laid out by leads A single-method composition laid out by leads might look something like this: Example: 1260 Grandsire Triples by Daniel W Brady The calling is laid out as a number of columns which should be read top-to-bottom. Each line represents a call made during the composition. Leadheads The first row of the lead in the touch indicated by the lead number. Since all compositions start from rounds, the first leadhead is almost always rounds. By convention, bells which do not change position between leadheads are usually omitted altogether. Lead numbers The number of leads after which the given leadhead occurs, measured from the previous leadhead. In the above example, the second leadhead is the fourth one reached after rounds. The next comes two leads after that, and so on. Calls The calls which, together with the method(s), produce the rows of the composition. When laid out by leads as above, it is assumed that a bob occurs unless another type of call is explicitly indicated. A composition of Spliced can also be laid out by leads, and may look something like this: Example: 1280 5-Spliced Surprise Major by Robert D S Brown (excerpt) Again, the calling is laid out in columns, and read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. In this case, every leadhead and call in the composition is given explicitly. The composition fragment above starts from rounds, the first leadhead, and the first method is Bristol. The dash (\u2013) to the left of the next leadhead indicates that a bob must be called in order to reach it. Then, the method changes to Lessness. At the end of the lead of Lessness, another bob is called to bring up the next leadhead, the method changes to Glasgow, and so on. Courseheads and leadheads Calls Calling positions Calling positions indicate to the conductor exactly where a call is supposed to take place. There are a number of different conventions regarding calling positions, and a number of standard names which conductors and composers need to be familiar with.

To get started, click on Create new > New method in the navbar or dropdown menu: The Add method page The Add method page ( https://complib.org/method/add ) has a number of fields which allow you to specify certain properties of your custom method. These are: Name (required) The name for your custom method. This will be used by Complib to generate the method's full title. See Things to consider when naming methods for advice on choosing a name for your custom method. Note Complib automatically appends the method's class descriptors and stage to its name to give the method's full title. As such, you should not add classification- or stage-specific words such as Treble Bob or Caters to the name field. Stage (required) The stage at which the method is to be rung. Complib supports methods on numbers from two to twenty-eight bells. Place Notation (required) The method's place notation. This can be specified in either full or condensed form. When verifying the method, Complib will automatically condense the place notation as much as possible. To learn how to use place notation, see Place notation . Division Ends (optional) For methods requiring divisions, specifies the row numbers at which the ends of each division occur. If the method has multiple divisions per lead, the corresponding division end rows should be separated with a colon (e.g., 2:8 ). Notes (optional) Specifies a message to be displayed in the Library Details tab of the custom method's page. This is a good place to put any important information about the method which you may want to keep to hand. Saving methods, method errors & warnings Complib will automatically attempt to validate a custom method as soon as its place notation is specified. If the provided place notation is valid, the custom method's full name, diagram and properties will be generated and displayed. Clicking the Validate button will force a re-validation. If the custom method is successfully validated, clicking the Save button will save the custom method as a private method . Method errors If Complib encounters a problem when attempting to validate a custom method, an error message will be displayed. All errors must be cleared before a custom method can be saved. There are a number of different error types. Most errors will give an indication of how to clear them. The following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the more common errors: Error: Place notation _ is invalid for stage... The identified element of place notation is not valid for the specified stage. Usually this means that the place specified in the place notation element does not exist at this stage. For example, attempting to validate the element 18 at stages lower than Major will generate this error. Error: Method title already used... The title generated for the custom method conflicts with the title of an already existing method. The custom method's name must be altered so that the generated title is unique. Error: Method place notation already exists as... The specified place notation is identical to that of an already existing method. The custom method's place notation must be altered so that it is unique. Error: Method cannot be classified... Complib cannot parse the specified place notation. This happens when the specified place notation does not conform to one of the accepted Method XML formats, or is empty. See Place notation to learn more about the place notations that Complib can accept. Error: Division Ends must be positive and less than the lead length. The specified division ends exceed the bounds of the method's lead. The division ends must be row numbers within the lead length of the method as determined from its place notation. Error: Division Ends must be unique. For custom methods with multiple divisions, two or more of the specified division ends are identical. All division ends must be unique row numbers within the method's lead. Warnings and other messages If method validation is successful, Complib may display a number of warnings and other messages. These are designed to notify you of any additional information you may wish to take into account when naming your custom method. This information may be redundant. Unlike method errors , warnings and other alerts will not prevent you from saving a custom method. Some of the warnings and other messages you may encounter include: Warning: Method title already used at a different stage... The custom method's generated title is identical to another method of the same class but differing stage. The current Central Council Framework requires that such methods belong to one of the accepted extension paths (see Extensions ). While you can save a custom method which does not belong to an accepted extension path, the method will not be able to be accepted under that name when rung. Warning: Method is related to ___ as a ___ extension... The custom method's place notation can be obtained from an existing method by following one of the accepted extension paths. When this happens, you will likely wish to give the custom method the same name as the existing method, provided that another method with that name does not already exist at the same stage as the custom method. Additionally, while this is expressed as a warning, there are circumstances under which you are obliged to name a method in accordance with an extension path if you wish to do so officially. See Extensions for an in-depth explanation of this topic. Information: Method is related to ___ ... The custom method is related to an existing method at the same stage. This occurs when the custom method is a halflead/leadend variant, or a Single/Double/Reverse form of the existing method. See Method pages > Related methods for more information about method relationships. Things to consider when naming methods It is a long-standing tradition of change ringing that anyone can name a method that has not previously been named, subsequent to a qualifying performance. You are able to give a custom method on Complib any name you like. However, if you intend to ring and name a method in a qualifying performance, you should bear the following points in mind: A method's name should be unique. Two methods cannot share the same title. Two methods at differing stages cannot share the same name and class, with the exception of methods that are accepted as belonging to the same extension path , or methods whose class is not expressed as part of its title (e.g. hybrid methods and principles). A method's name should be human-readable and pronounceable. A method's name should be something that a human being can read and say aloud. As such, method names should not consist exclusively of punctuation, numerals or other symbols. A method's name should not contain offensive or abusive language. The Central Council reserves the right to rename methods before they can be accepted into the Central Council's Method Library. Method names which are offensive or which contain terms considered to be hate speech are extremely likely to be rejected outright. While not a formal requirement, it is also worth considering the value of good taste when naming methods. The precise determination of this is, of course, subjective. A method has not been officially named until it is rung. According to tradition, the initial right to determine a method's name is afforded to the band which first rings it in a compliant performance . A custom method which you save to Complib under a certain name may be rung under a different name by someone else, and it is under the latter name that the method will be officially recognised. For a full explanation of the requirements for method names, see Section 5 of the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing. Private and public methods A custom method which is successfully saved to Complib will be designated a private method and given its own method page . A private method has not been officially named until it is performed and accepted into the Central Council's Method Library. When this happens, the method will be automatically added to Complib's CCCBR library. Any private methods which have identical place notation to a newly recognised method will be deleted, and any compositions using such private methods will be automatically changed to use the new public method. Sharing private methods via link Under normal circumstances, a private method is only visible to the user who created it. However, you may wish to share your private methods with other people under certain circumstances. Complib gives you the ability to do this by way of a special link which can be generated via the private method's page. To generate the link, click the share button in the toolbar on the private method's page. This will open a window containing a link which you can copy to your clipboard. Sharing private methods via published compositions Another way to share private methods is by publishing a composition which includes the private method as part of its definition. Warning Private methods shared via published compositions will be visible to all registered users , though they will not appear in method searches to anyone other than their owners. Please be sure that you are happy with your private method to be widely available before publishing a composition which uses it. Editing and deleting methods To edit a custom method, click on the edit button in the toolbar. This will open the method in the editor, allowing you to change the name, place notation and other aspects of the method as if you were creating it afresh. Warning Be careful about editing custom methods which feature in compositions you have saved, as changing the method's place notation or stage will likely invalidate them. Complib does not check to see if any of your private or public compositions will be affected by an alteration made to a custom method. You must take care of any such cases yourself. To delete a custom method, click on the delete button in the toolbar. This will bring up a prompt asking you to confirm that you want to delete the method. If you are sure, clicking on Confirm Delete will mark the custom method for deletion and remove it from your private methods. Methods marked for deletion can no longer be found via searches, though their pages will remain active for a certain period before being permanently removed, and all links to such pages will still function for the duration of this period. A method marked for deletion will have a special icon next to its name. Warning As with editing custom methods, you should bear in mind the effect that deleting a custom method may have on any compositions you have saved.","title":"Adding methods"},{"location":"methods/adding_methods/#adding-methods","text":"Complib gives registered users the ability to create custom methods.

A method's name should be human-readable and pronounceable. A method's name should be something that a human being can read and say aloud. As such, method names should not consist exclusively of punctuation, numerals or other symbols. A method's name should not contain offensive or abusive language. The Central Council reserves the right to rename methods before they can be accepted into the Central Council's Method Library. Method names which are offensive or which contain terms considered to be hate speech are extremely likely to be rejected outright. While not a formal requirement, it is also worth considering the value of good taste when naming methods. The precise determination of this is, of course, subjective. A method has not been officially named until it is rung. According to tradition, the initial right to determine a method's name is afforded to the band which first rings it in a compliant performance . A custom method which you save to Complib under a certain name may be rung under a different name by someone else, and it is under the latter name that the method will be officially recognised. For a full explanation of the requirements for method names, see Section 5 of the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing.","title":"Things to consider when naming methods"},{"location":"methods/adding_methods/#private-and-public-methods","text":"A custom method which is successfully saved to Complib will be designated a private method and given its own method page .

These properties are listed in the method page's Properties tab . When expanded, the top of the tab shows a number of checkboxes, each of which corresponds to a different potential feature of the method. Changes A method consists of a set of rows rung in sequence. The relationship between two subsequent rows with regard to how bells move from one row to the other is referred to as a change . There are a number of different types of change that can be made between subsequent rows of a method: Adjacent The method only contains changes where bells move at most one place between rows. All traditional methods fall into this category. Identity The method contains a change where no bells move place. Example Reverse Court Singles Jump The method contains a change where a bell moves more than one place (for example, the change between the rows 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 2 3 1 4 6 5 ). Methods containing jump changes are referred to as Jump methods. Example Double Simple Jump Minimus Static The changes of the method are fixed, which is to say that they are not altered as the method is rung (unless a call is made). Dynamic The changes of the method are not fixed, and are dynamically altered as the method is rung. One type of \"method\" with dynamic changes is the loosely defined family of Dixonoids , where places are made depending on which numbered bell is leading. Complib does not currently support the definition of methods with dynamic changes. Cross The method's place notation contains the cross change. This means that there is at least one change when no bell remains in the same place as in the previous row. Penultimate The method contains a change where: A place is made in the penultimate position in the row (e.g., 5ths made in Minor, 7ths made in Major); and The principle hunt bell is not in either of the last two places when the place is made. Example Aldrin Surprise Minor In each lead of Aldrin Surprise Minor, two bells make 5ths under bells which are not the treble. The fact that a bell makes 5ths under the treble at the half-lead is ignored. Historically, ringers have tended to avoid methods at even stages which have a penultimate place made. The reason is that this (usually) results in backstroke rows with the two heaviest bells reversed, which is considered by many to be unmusical. Hunt bells Methods can fall into one of two distinct categories depending on the presence or absence of a hunt bell . Hunt bell A hunt bell is a bell which returns to the same place at the start of each lead/division. Principle A method with no hunt bells (e.g. Stedman, Erin). Hunter A method with one or more hunt bells. Hunters are further classified depending on the number of hunt bells: One indicates that there is a single hunt bell (e.g. Plain Bob). Multiple indicates that there are multiple hunt bells (e.g. Grandsire). All indicates that all the bells are hunt bells (e.g. 12 Victoria Street Surprise Minor ). In this case, the plain course of the method is a single lead/division long. Historically, methods of this kind came under the umbrella classification of blocks , a term which has since been retired. Working bell cycles All bells in a method which are not hunt bells are referred to as working bells . The plain course of a method involves the working bells moving through one or more cycles of place bells. Monocyclic The working bells are all part of the same cycle: all working bells ring all the distinct place bells during a plain course. The plain course is the same length as the number of leads in the cycle. Isocyclic The working bells are divided up into two more cycles, all of which are the same length. In this case, the plain course is the same length as the number of leads in any one of the cycles. Differential The working bells are divided up into two or more cycles of different lengths. Here, the plain course is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of all the cycles. Hunter classes All methods which are hunters (see Hunt Bells ) can be further divided into a number of different classes . The different hunter classes are arranged in a hierarchy as follows: Plain Place Bob Single* Treble Dodging Treble Bob Delight Surprise Alliance Treble Place Hybrid Little ** A method with a single non-stationary hunt bell will fall into one and only one hunter class. Note * Single is not strictly speaking a method class, but a specific subtype of Plain method with certain properties. ** A method may be Little in addition to its main hunter class. For a detailed explanation of the different hunter classes and how they are distinguished, please refer to Section 4 of the Central Council Framework . Symmetry A symmetry is a transformation (rotation, reflection, translation, etc.) which leaves the appearance of something unchanged. A method has one or more symmetry types : Asymmetric The method has no symmetry. Palindromic The method is the same when rung forwards and backwards. Equivalently, the method's line is the same when reflected in an axis perpendicular to the direction of the line. Double The method is the same when transformed in any of the following equivalent ways: The method's place notation is inverted (see Place notation ). The method's rows are written back to front (e.g. 1 2 3 4 becomes 4 3 2 1 ). The method's line is viewed from the reverse side of a sheet of paper, or held up to a mirror. The method's line is reflected in an axis parallel to the direction of the line and shifted along the same axis by some amount (known mathematically as a glide reflection ). Rotational The method is the same when rotated one half-turn about a point. For palindromic methods there is also one symmetry subtype: Offset A palindromic method whose axis of symmetry is not at the halfway point of its place notation. Many twin hunt methods such as Grandsire fall into this category. For a visual demonstration of the different symmetry types, see this infographic . Leadheads Almost all methods (currently all methods in Complib's CCCBR library) have a plain course which can be divided into one or more sections of fixed, finite length, which are called leads or divisions . It is common to refer to the starting row of a lead (or division) as the leadhead (or division end ). The collected set of leadheads of a method may satisfy one of a number of conditions: Plain Bob The leadhead rows form a (non-trivial) subset of the leadheads of Plain Bob on the same number of bells. Grandsire The leadhead rows form a (non-trivial) subset of the leadheads of Grandsire on the same number of bells. Original The leadhead rows form a (non-trivial) subset of the division ends of Original on the same number of bells. Cyclic The leadhead rows form a (non-trivial) subset of the cyclic rotations of rounds on the same number of bells (e.g. 2 3 4 5 1 , 3 4 5 1 2 , etc.). Rounds The method has only one lead/division and therefore only one leadhead, which must necessarily be equal to rounds on the same number of bells. Note There are methods whose leadheads do not fall into any of the above categories (though a significant majority of methods do). Course properties Taken as a whole, the plain course of the method can have certain properties which may be of particular interest: True plain course The method has a plain course which is true . True leads The plain course comprises leads which are individually true (but which may be false against each other). Right place All places in the plain course are made right (i.e., rung handstroke-backstroke). Uneven parity For principles, this means that the plain course contains an unequal number of odd and even rows (see Row Parity ). For hunters, this means that there are an unequal number of odd and even rows for any given position in the hunt path of the principal hunt bell . Layered Each row of the plain course can be separated into two or more non-overlapping groups of bells in contiguous positions such that no bell strays outside of its starting group during the course. For example, Plain Bob Minor rung on 8 bells with 7 and 8 dodging behind is equivalent to the layered method Broadley Little Bob Major . Miscellaneous In addition to the above, the properties tab also lists miscellaneous information about the method in text form. The listed items are: Place notation The method's place notation, given in Method XML format (see Place notation ). Leadhead The row reached after a single plain lead and, if applicable, the method's alphanumeric leadhead code . Divisions Gives the length and arrangement of the method's division(s) if applicable. The length of each division is the number of rows it contains. If the method has more than one division per lead, the lengths of each division are listed and separated by colons (e.g. 6:6 ). If the method is usually started at a point other than the start of a division , the starting point for the first division will be specified. For example, 6:6 after row 2 means that the divisions have lengths of 6 and 6, with the first division starting after row 2. Tip When counting rows, remember that the method starts from row 0. Default calls The call type determines which calls will be used by default when creating a composition for the method. The call types that Complib recognises are: Near : calls default toward the front of the change (e.g. 4ths place bobs). Far : calls default toward the back of the change (e.g. n-2's place bobs). Mixed : the method uses multiple call types. Grandsire : the method uses Grandsire-type calls. Stedman : the method uses Stedman-type calls. None : the method has no specified call type. Method above/below For methods which are hunters, if the method shares above/below work with another method that was rung prior to it, that method will be listed here. The method listed will (with some exceptions) be the earliest applicable method rung to a peal. Note The exceptions to this are where a method which is much more widely known was nevertheless rung to a peal after another more obscure method sharing the same above/below work. One such example is New Cambridge Surprise Major , which was pealed almost 50 years before Cambridge Surprise Major even though the latter was (pretty obviously!) known to the Exercise before the former. FCH Groups Lists the codes for the method's false coursehead groups (if applicable). See this section of the Central Council Framework for a definition of the false course head groups. Accepted extension path For methods with a compliant extension or contraction which has been named, lists the extension path(s) used to derive the accepted extension(s) or contraction(s) (see Extensions ). Compositions designed for this method The number of (published) compositions on Complib which include this method in their definition. Clicking on the number will jump to a search which lists them all. Leads in course The number of leads in the plain course of the method. This is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of its working bell cycles (see Working bell cycles ). Lead length The number of rows in a plain lead. This is also equal to the number of elements in the method's expanded place notation. Plain course length The number of rows in the method's plain course. This is equal to the number of leads in the course multiplied by the lead length. Hunt bells The number of bells which return to the same position they started in at the end of each lead (see Hunt bells ). Working bells The number of bells which end each lead in a different position from where they started. Also equal to the total number of bells minus the number of hunt bells and stationary bells. Stationary bells The number of bells which do not change place for the whole of the plain course. Maximum blows in one place The maximum number of times any bell remains in the same place between consecutive rows of the method.

For example, Plain Bob Minor rung on 8 bells with 7 and 8 dodging behind is equivalent to the layered method Broadley Little Bob Major .","title":"Course properties"},{"location":"methods/method_properties/#miscellaneous","text":"In addition to the above, the properties tab also lists miscellaneous information about the method in text form. The listed items are: Place notation The method's place notation, given in Method XML format (see Place notation ). Leadhead The row reached after a single plain lead and, if applicable, the method's alphanumeric leadhead code . Divisions Gives the length and arrangement of the method's division(s) if applicable. The length of each division is the number of rows it contains. If the method has more than one division per lead, the lengths of each division are listed and separated by colons (e.g. 6:6 ). If the method is usually started at a point other than the start of a division , the starting point for the first division will be specified. For example, 6:6 after row 2 means that the divisions have lengths of 6 and 6, with the first division starting after row 2. Tip When counting rows, remember that the method starts from row 0. Default calls The call type determines which calls will be used by default when creating a composition for the method. The call types that Complib recognises are: Near : calls default toward the front of the change (e.g. 4ths place bobs). Far : calls default toward the back of the change (e.g. n-2's place bobs). Mixed : the method uses multiple call types. Grandsire : the method uses Grandsire-type calls. Stedman : the method uses Stedman-type calls. None : the method has no specified call type. Method above/below For methods which are hunters, if the method shares above/below work with another method that was rung prior to it, that method will be listed here. The method listed will (with some exceptions) be the earliest applicable method rung to a peal. Note The exceptions to this are where a method which is much more widely known was nevertheless rung to a peal after another more obscure method sharing the same above/below work. One such example is New Cambridge Surprise Major , which was pealed almost 50 years before Cambridge Surprise Major even though the latter was (pretty obviously!) known to the Exercise before the former. FCH Groups Lists the codes for the method's false coursehead groups (if applicable). See this section of the Central Council Framework for a definition of the false course head groups. Accepted extension path For methods with a compliant extension or contraction which has been named, lists the extension path(s) used to derive the accepted extension(s) or contraction(s) (see Extensions ). Compositions designed for this method The number of (published) compositions on Complib which include this method in their definition. Clicking on the number will jump to a search which lists them all. Leads in course The number of leads in the plain course of the method. This is equal to the least common multiple of the lengths of its working bell cycles (see Working bell cycles ). Lead length The number of rows in a plain lead. This is also equal to the number of elements in the method's expanded place notation. Plain course length The number of rows in the method's plain course. This is equal to the number of leads in the course multiplied by the lead length. Hunt bells The number of bells which return to the same position they started in at the end of each lead (see Hunt bells ). Working bells The number of bells which end each lead in a different position from where they started. Also equal to the total number of bells minus the number of hunt bells and stationary bells. Stationary bells The number of bells which do not change place for the whole of the plain course. Maximum blows in one place The maximum number of times any bell remains in the same place between consecutive rows of the method. Music score (default music scheme) The music score of the plain course of the method, as determined by the default music scheme .","title":"Miscellaneous"},{"location":"methods/overview/","text":"Method pages Complib acts as a method collection, and has dedicated pages for all methods in its libraries , including every method officially named and rung.

Properties The structural properties of the method, including its place notation , leadhead group , extension path (if applicable) and more. A large amount of this information relates to the method's classification , which derives from the Central Council's Framework for Method Ringing .

Related Methods Any methods which are related to the current method, such as halflead/leadend variants and methods belonging to the same extension family (whether compliant with the Central Council Framework or not). Trivial Variations Any methods which are considered to be trivial variations of the current method. Performances Historical information about occasions when the method has been performed, including when it was first rung and named and any recognised record lengths, with links to the relevant Bellboard performance (if provided). References A list of all accessible collections containing the method. If you own a private collection containing the method, it will be listed here. Library Details The method's Complib-specific metadata including which library it is contained within, the corresponding method ID , and its dates of creation, publication, etc. Blue line This tab renders a visual representation of the method. By default, this is done in the traditional Diagrams style with all hunt bells plus a single working bell drawn in coloured lines. The method's grid , which consists of a single lead/division with all bells drawn in coloured lines, is also shown by default. The appearance of the blue line display is highly customisable. For more information about how to adjust the display style, see Customising the blue line . Note You need to be logged in as a registered user to adjust the Blue Line display style. Properties See the page on Method properties for an explanation of the information in this tab. Hunt bell path(s) See Advanced > Hunt bell properties for an explanation of the information in this tab. Related methods Methods may be related to other methods in a number of different ways. Methods which are related to the current method in any of the following ways will be listed in this tab. Halflead/leadend variants A halflead/leadend variant of a method is any method which differs from it only by which change is made at the halflead/leadend. For example, Cambridge Surprise Minor and Primrose Surprise Minor are leadend variants. Hovering over the name of a halflead/leadend variant will indicate the way in which its halflead (HL) and/or leadend (LE) differs from the current method. Reverse The reverse of a method is the method obtained by reversing all its rows. Equivalently, it is the method obtained by inverting the method's place notation (see Place notation ). Double work above/below For methods with a single hunt bell, the combination of the work done above/below the hunt bell with an inverted copy of itself will give a double method, which may or may not have been named. Extensions Two methods at different stages are extensions of one another if they are related by any of the recognised extension paths . If the method can be extended using any of the recognised extension paths, methods in the path will be listed up to stage Twenty-Four (see Extensions ). Non-conforming extensions If two methods share the same name and class but are not related by any of the recognised extension paths, then they are non-conforming extensions of one another. A previously non-conforming extension may become a conforming extension in the event that: a new extension pathway becomes recognised; and the previously non-conforming extension can be obtained by application of that new pathway. Note There are a number of reasons why a method may be listed on Complib as a non-conforming extension. These include (but are not limited to): The method (or another method related to it) was named and rung before the formal framework of method extension was developed, or before computer analysis was available to aid in spotting naming conflicts. The method is non-palindromic. No systematic framework for extending non-palindromic methods yet exists (although Complib can currently handle a limited number of cases). Method classification and extension is still a field of active development, and over the centuries it has reflected changing values within the Exercise. For the most part, there is a general agreement that more rigorous modern practices should be balanced with the preservation of ringing history. Trivial variations This tab lists all named methods which are related to the current method by means of a trivial variation , together with their place notations. Trivial variations are ways of slightly altering the blue line of a method without changing its overall structure. The image above shows the first leads of Yorkshire Surprise Major (left) and Quedgeley Surprise Major (right), which are trivial variations of each other. It can be seen by inspection that the two are almost identical, with only slight differences in the blue line. Complib will determine that two methods are trivial variations if the following conditions all hold: There is a sequence of adjacent changes in the lead where the same two bells are working together in both methods; and The bells are in the same relative position at the start of the sequence in both methods; and The bells are in the same relative position at the end of the sequence in both methods; and The methods differ only by sequences satisfying conditions 1-3. The word \"trivial\" is not a value judgement: it does not imply that one method is inherently more original or valuable than another. It is a purely technical classification which describes a similarity between them. Indeed, the property of trivial variation is a symmetric relationship: if method B is a trivial variation of method A, then method A is necessarily a trivial variation of method B. Warning A method might differ from its trivial variants in decidedly non-trivial ways. Their plain courses may not have the same rows, and they may have different false coursehead groups . Because of this, a composition which is true to one method is not necessarily true to all (or indeed any) of that method's trivial variations. You should always check a composition is true to the specific method you wish to ring. Performances This tab lists any documented performances of the method which have been added to its Complib page. Each entry has three fields: Date The date on which the performance was rung. Type Specifies one of a number of different performance types: First inclusion in a peal/quarter peal/etc. : a multi-method performance where the method is recognised to have been rung for the first time. First peal/quarter peal/etc. : a single-method performance where the method is recognised to have been rung for the first time (or, for methods previously rung in a multi-method performance, the first time it was rung by itself). First extent : for methods at stages Minor and below, a performance containing an extent of the method at that stage where the method is recognised to have been rung for the first time. Long Length : a performance of 10,000 changes or more. Performances are further typified by their Ringing Style: Towerbell : a traditional performance on towerbells using ropes and wheels; Handbell : a double-handed performance on handbells, either with real handbells or with an electronic substitute; Keyboard : a performance in which bell sounds are achieved by pressing a keyboard, either analogue (e.g. a carillon) or digital (e.g. a computer keyboard); Other : a performance which does not fit into any of the above categories, such as tapped performances; Mixed : a performance in which a mixture of the above are used. For more about Ringing Styles and how performances are reported, see Section 6 of the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing. Details The published details of the performance: title, performing Guild or Association (if given), location, and conductor (if given). Note There is an order of priority within performance types, which broadly corresponds with length. The priority order is, from highest to lowest: Long length First peal First inclusion in a peal First quarter peal First inclusion in a quarter peal First extent A performance is typically only included if no performance of that length or greater has been recorded prior to that date. Once a performance of greater length has been recorded, shorter performances from after that date will no longer be added (but will be retained if added previously). The exception to this is long lengths , which will always be recorded. References This tab lists all collections which you have access to and which reference the current method (inaccessible private collections will not be displayed). Each entry has four fields, with most entries acting as links to external references or to other pages in the Composition Library: Collection The name of the collection to which the method belongs.

Most often they are represented visually as a blue line diagram , which can aid in memorisation. Some methods can be learned according to a rule such as \"first, treble-bob, last, near, full, far...\" which expresses the blue line as a short phrase. However, in order to refer to a specific method uniquely, we need a (compact) way of expressing what exactly every bell does while ringing it. Place notation is a tool invented in order to do just that. The basic concept We'll be making use of the following definitions: Row An ordering of the bells 1 to n , where n is the total number of bells being rung. A row is written in ringing order left to right. Each bell rings once and only once within a row. For example: 135246 is a row; 987654321 is a row; 113478 is not a row (why?). Change The action of moving from one row to another by altering the order of the bells; or, the relationship between two rows in terms of how they differ. In order to qualify as a change, the following condition must be satisfied: The two rows must have the same number of bells. For most of change ringing history, changes were also required to satisfy a second condition: In going from one row to another, no bell should move more than one position forward or backward within the row. Changes which do not satisfy this latter condition are known as jump changes . Methods using jump changes are still extremely rare, and so we will assume for the moment that we are dealing with changes which satisfy both of the conditions above. Consider these two rows related by a change: A: 1 4 2 5 3 6 B: 4 1 2 3 5 6 How can we express the change? We can start by making a note of which bells do not change position between the two rows. In the above example, bells 2 and 6 are the only ones which remain fixed across the change. We could try writing down the numbers of the bells, but that would not be a sensible solution. To see why, consider this other pair of rows related by a change: C: 6 5 4 3 2 1 D: 5 6 4 2 3 1 It should be apparent that the relationship between rows C and D is the same as that between rows A and B: if we were to relabel the bells in row C so as to match row A, then the row D obtained under the same relabelling would match row B. In other words, the change between rows A and B is the same as the change between rows C and D, even though the rows themselves are different. Any sensible notation should be able to express this in a way which is independent of the specific rows. Therefore, rather than the numbers of the bells which do not move between rows, we should note the position of those bells instead. Here's the first example again, this time with lines drawn to show the motion of the bells between rows: A: 1 4 2 5 3 6 x | x | B: 4 1 2 3 5 6 Bells 2 and 6 are the only ones which stay in the same place, those places being 3rd and 6th within the row. Similarly, going from row C to row D, the bells in positions 3 and 6 are the only ones which don't move: C: 6 5 4 3 2 1 x | x | D: 5 6 4 2 3 1 In change ringing, a bell which stays in the same position between rows is said to make a place in that position. Place notation is so named because it expresses changes exclusively in terms of which places are made between rows. Place notation elements and strings To represent a change, we list the positions of the bells which make places between two rows in numerical order. The change in the examples above would be written as 36 . This is an element of place notation (sometimes also called a unit ). Each element of place notation expresses a single change. Here are some more example changes and the place notation elements which represent them: 1 3 2 5 4 6 | | x x 1 3 5 2 6 4 Place notation: 12 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 8 | x | | x | 1 5 3 7 2 6 4 8 Place notation: 1458 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 x | x x | | | 2 1 3 5 4 7 6 8 9 0 Place notation: 3890 There is a special type of change possible on even numbers of bells in which no bell makes a place between rows. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 x x x 2 1 4 3 6 5 This change is sometimes called the cross change , and is notated using the special element \u2013 (or x ). To perform a method, several changes must be made one after the other in sequence. To use place notation to write methods, we need a way of concatenating place notation elements together. A string of place notation is a series of elements written in sequence. To avoid ambiguity about the boundaries between elements, dots . are added between any two elements which are not the cross change. For example, the sequence of changes in which change 14 is followed by change 36 , which is followed by change 1458 , would be written 14.36.1458 . It is not necessary to use dots to mark the bounds of the cross change: replacing 36 with the cross change in the former example would give 14-1458 . This simple notation is already powerful enough to uniquely express every \"conventional\" method that has ever been rung. For example, here are some place notation strings corresponding to a single lead of some well known methods: Plain Bob Minor -16-16-16-16-16-12 Cambridge Surprise Minor -36-14-12-36-14-56-14-36-12-14-36-12 Bristol Surprise Major -58-14.58-58.36.14-14.58-14-18-14-58.14-14.36.58-58.14-58-18 Condensed place notation Strings of place notation can become rather cumbersome when written out in full. However, for many methods we may leverage their inherent symmetry to produce a condensed form of the place notation. The very significant majority of named methods are palindromic , which means that their sequence of changes is the same when reversed. Looking at the three examples above, if we ignore the final elements in each case, the remaining strings are all symmetrical about their central elements. For example, take Cambridge Surprise Minor: -36-14-12-36-14- 56 -14-36-12-14-36-(12) The lead has a symmetry point at the change 56 (and also at the final change, if you want to be picky). This means that this place notation string is about twice as long as it needs to be, because all the changes in the second half are already expressed in the first half in reverse order. We can now introduce the convention that a comma , within a place notation string separates any palindromic substrings. With this convention, the place notation for Cambridge becomes -36-14-12-36-14-56,12 The full place notation can be obtained from the condensed form by way of the following steps: List the elements before the comma from left to right; List the elements before the comma from right to left; Join the strings obtained from steps 1 and 2 together at the repeated element; Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the section after the comma; Concatenate the strings obtained from steps 3 and 5. Writing these steps out for our example, we have: Step 1: List the elements before the comma from left to right. -36-14-12-36-14-56 Step 2: List the elements before the comma from right to left. 56-14-36-12-14-36- Step 3: Join the strings obtained from steps 1 and 2 together at the repeated element. -36-14-12-36-14-56-14-36-12-14-36- Step 4: Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the section after the comma. 12 Step 5: Concatenate the strings obtained from steps 3 and 5. -36-14-12-36-14-56-14-36-12-14-36-12 And we are done. Step 4 seems somewhat trivial in this example because the substring after the comma in the condensed place notation has only a single element. However, it is crucial that both substrings be treated as palindromic for this convention to work. This is because there are many palindromic methods which have their points of symmetry in a different place. The best example of this is Grandsire, in which the point of palindromic symmetry is offset from the midpoint of the lead. The full place notation for a lead of Grandsire Doubles is 3.1.5.1.5.1.5.1.5.1 which condenses to 3,1.5.1.5.1 Alternative conventions When creating a custom method on Complib, you may use either the full or condensed form of the notation as specified above. You can use either \u2013 or x to represent the cross change. Complib will automatically condense the notation when validating the method, provided that the place notation itself is valid. While they can't be used for defining methods on Complib, there are other conventions for writing place notation, many of which are still very common. For the sake of convenience, here are a few you are likely to encounter elsewhere. MicroSIRIL notation MicroSIRIL notation consists of three parts: a method group indicator, a symmetry indicator, and the place notation itself. Method group indicator This is the alphanumeric code which specifies the first leadhead of the method, as well as what change is made at the leadend (see Leadhead codes ). A code of z indicates that the method does not have a standard leadhead code. In such cases, the place notation will be given in full. Symmetry indicator An ampersand & at the start of a place notation string is used to indicate that the string which follows is palindromic about its last element. This is similar to the comma notation. For example, &-16-14 represents the same string as -16-14, A plus symbol + is used to indicate that the following string is non-palindromic, and should be read verbatim. Example: Cambridge Surprise Minor In the MicroSIRIL format, Cambridge Surprise Minor is written: b &-36-14-12-36-14-56 From this we can read off that the method is in group b , meaning the leadend change is 12 , and that the method is palindromic. Example: Scientific Triples In MicroSIRIL format, Scientific Triples is written: z +3.1.7.1.5.1.7.1.7.5.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.5.1.5.1.7.1.7.1.7.1.7 The method group indicator is z, meaning that it does not have a standard leadhead code. + indicates the place notation should be read as-is, and should not be interpreted as palindromic. Leadhead change A place notation element prefixed with lh or le , or sometimes simply separated from the main string by a space, is used to denote the leadhead (or leadend) change. This is most often used as an alternative to the method group indicator in MicroSIRIL format. Sometimes the actual leadhead row will be given rather than the place notation element. In order to obtain the terminal element, you will need to work out what change must be made at the end of the lead to get to the specified row. Jump changes Coming soon!","title":"Place notation"},{"location":"methods/place_notation/#place-notation","text":"There are many different ways that change ringing methods can be written down. Most often they are represented visually as a blue line diagram , which can aid in memorisation. Some methods can be learned according to a rule such as \"first, treble-bob, last, near, full, far...\" which expresses the blue line as a short phrase. However, in order to refer to a specific method uniquely, we need a (compact) way of expressing what exactly every bell does while ringing it. Place notation is a tool invented in order to do just that.","title":"Place notation"},{"location":"methods/place_notation/#the-basic-concept","text":"We'll be making use of the following definitions: Row An ordering of the bells 1 to n , where n is the total number of bells being rung. A row is written in ringing order left to right. Each bell rings once and only once within a row. For example: 135246 is a row; 987654321 is a row; 113478 is not a row (why?). Change The action of moving from one row to another by altering the order of the bells; or, the relationship between two rows in terms of how they differ. In order to qualify as a change, the following condition must be satisfied: The two rows must have the same number of bells. For most of change ringing history, changes were also required to satisfy a second condition: In going from one row to another, no bell should move more than one position forward or backward within the row. Changes which do not satisfy this latter condition are known as jump changes . Methods using jump changes are still extremely rare, and so we will assume for the moment that we are dealing with changes which satisfy both of the conditions above. Consider these two rows related by a change: A: 1 4 2 5 3 6 B: 4 1 2 3 5 6 How can we express the change? We can start by making a note of which bells do not change position between the two rows. In the above example, bells 2 and 6 are the only ones which remain fixed across the change. We could try writing down the numbers of the bells, but that would not be a sensible solution. To see why, consider this other pair of rows related by a change: C: 6 5 4 3 2 1 D: 5 6 4 2 3 1 It should be apparent that the relationship between rows C and D is the same as that between rows A and B: if we were to relabel the bells in row C so as to match row A, then the row D obtained under the same relabelling would match row B. In other words, the change between rows A and B is the same as the change between rows C and D, even though the rows themselves are different. Any sensible notation should be able to express this in a way which is independent of the specific rows. Therefore, rather than the numbers of the bells which do not move between rows, we should note the position of those bells instead. Here's the first example again, this time with lines drawn to show the motion of the bells between rows: A: 1 4 2 5 3 6 x | x | B: 4 1 2 3 5 6 Bells 2 and 6 are the only ones which stay in the same place, those places being 3rd and 6th within the row. Similarly, going from row C to row D, the bells in positions 3 and 6 are the only ones which don't move: C: 6 5 4 3 2 1 x | x | D: 5 6 4 2 3 1 In change ringing, a bell which stays in the same position between rows is said to make a place in that position. Place notation is so named because it expresses changes exclusively in terms of which places are made between rows.","title":"The basic concept"},{"location":"methods/place_notation/#place-notation-elements-and-strings","text":"To represent a change, we list the positions of the bells which make places between two rows in numerical order. The change in the examples above would be written as 36 . This is an element of place notation (sometimes also called a unit ). Each element of place notation expresses a single change. Here are some more example changes and the place notation elements which represent them: 1 3 2 5 4 6 | | x x 1 3 5 2 6 4 Place notation: 12 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 8 | x | | x | 1 5 3 7 2 6 4 8 Place notation: 1458 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 x | x x | | | 2 1 3 5 4 7 6 8 9 0 Place notation: 3890 There is a special type of change possible on even numbers of bells in which no bell makes a place between rows. For example: 1 2 3 4 5 6 x x x 2 1 4 3 6 5 This change is sometimes called the cross change , and is notated using the special element \u2013 (or x ). To perform a method, several changes must be made one after the other in sequence. To use place notation to write methods, we need a way of concatenating place notation elements together. A string of place notation is a series of elements written in sequence. To avoid ambiguity about the boundaries between elements, dots . are added between any two elements which are not the cross change. For example, the sequence of changes in which change 14 is followed by change 36 , which is followed by change 1458 , would be written 14.36.1458 . It is not necessary to use dots to mark the bounds of the cross change: replacing 36 with the cross change in the former example would give 14-1458 . This simple notation is already powerful enough to uniquely express every \"conventional\" method that has ever been rung. For example, here are some place notation strings corresponding to a single lead of some well known methods: Plain Bob Minor -16-16-16-16-16-12 Cambridge Surprise Minor -36-14-12-36-14-56-14-36-12-14-36-12 Bristol Surprise Major -58-14.58-58.36.14-14.58-14-18-14-58.14-14.36.58-58.14-58-18","title":"Place notation elements and strings"},{"location":"methods/place_notation/#condensed-place-notation","text":"Strings of place notation can become rather cumbersome when written out in full.
