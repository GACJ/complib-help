# Quick search
There are a number of different tools at your disposal for searching the Composition Library. The simplest of these is **Quick search**.

You can perform a Quick search via the Navigation bar at the top of every page. Simply start to type the name of what you're looking for in the search field, and Complib will begin suggesting possible matches.

Click on an item to navigate to the relevant page.

Quick search results will be organised into groups depending on their type. The four types are **Methods, Compositions, Collections** and **Composers**.

At the bottom of each group is a link to **"view `__` results"**. Clicking on this will take you to a page which lists all the search results in that group.

    You must be a registered user and be logged in to view the complete list of search results.

Quick search is very useful if you already know more or less what you are looking for. But maybe you don't know the name of a method, only some of its features. Or perhaps you'd like to search for compositions based on how easy they are to call.

Fortunately, Complib lets you perform searches like these very easily with dedicated search pages for [methods](method_search.md), [compositions](composition_search.md) and [collections](collection_search.md).
