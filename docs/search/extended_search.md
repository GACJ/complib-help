# Extended search
A Quick search allows you to search the method, composition and collections libraries by title. The dedicated method, composition and collection search pages allow you to specify a large number of filters in order to find methods and compositions with specified properties. 

However, neither type of search is able to test compositions and methods against each other. This requires an **extended search**.

!!! note
    The ability to perform extended searches is restricted to **Power Users**.
