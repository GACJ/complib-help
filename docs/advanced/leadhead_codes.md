# Leadhead codes
*The information on this page is a partial reproduction of [Appendix C: Leadhead Codes](https://framework.cccbr.org.uk/version2/leadheadcodes.html) from the Central Council Framework for Method Ringing. Any deviation from the Framework on factual grounds is unintentional, and should be disregarded in favour of the Framework in all cases.*

The majority of methods which are commonly rung have leadheads which are the same as those found in the plain courses of Plain Bob and Grandsire at the same stage. The reason for this is that these leadheads are the only ones which preserve the *coursing order of the working (non-hunt) bells*.

It is convenient to have a shorthand for which Plain Bob/Grandsire leadhead the method reaches at the end of its first lead. This leadhead determines the place bell order, or *cycle of work*, of the method. Two methods which reach the same leadhead at the end of their first leads have the same place bell order.

## Plain Bob leadheads
Methods with Plain Bob leadheads are split into groups depending on what change is made at the leadend in the absence of calls.

### Even stages
At even stages:

- Methods with a leadend change of `12` are given leadhead codes **[a–f]**.
- Methods with a leadend change of `1n` are given leadhead codes **[g–m]** (excluding letter i, to avoid confusion with the number 1).

Stages higher than *n*=8 supplement the letter code with a number if needed.

### Odd stages
At odd stages:

- Methods with a leadend change of `12n` are given leadhead codes **[p–q]**.
- Methods with a leadend change of `1` are given leadhead codes **[r–s]**.

All odd stages supplement some leadhead codes with numbers.
