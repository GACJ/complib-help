# Core Concepts

## Methods, Compositions and Collections
Complib has a dedicated page for every [method](methods/overview.md) in its various [libraries](#the-libraries), including all those which have been officially named and rung. Complib allows you to quickly look up the blue line and rows of a method, as well as anything else you might want to know about it. In addition, Complib allows users to [define their own methods](methods/adding_methods.md) using [place notation](methods/place_notation.md).

Complib contains a large number of [compositions](compositions/overview.md), which are specified callings for a performance. These range in scope from simple practice-night touches to full peals and long lengths. Users can search for compositions fitting various criteria, [publish compositions of their own](compositions/adding_compositions_overview.md), and rate their favourites. You can even request compositions from other users.

[Collections](collections/overview.md) are as their name suggests: collections of methods, compositions or both. They are a convenient way to organise information in one place, with links to the relevant Complib pages.

## The Libraries
Methods, compositions and collections on Complib are contained in one or more designated **libraries**, of which there are four:

 CCCBR
 :  A method-specific library. Contains all methods officially named and rung in compliance with the Central Council [Framework for Method Ringing](https://framework.cccbr.org.uk/). This library is maintained by the Central Council's Technical & Taxonomy Workgroup.

![Provisional method icon](img/provisional.png){ width="30" } Provisional
:   A method-specific library. Contains methods that, at the time they were named and rung, did not qualify for inclusion in the Central Council's Methods Library, but which may become eligible in future. Methods in the provisional library have a visual indicator on their method page to help identify them.

Public
:   Contains any methods, compositions or collections which have been **published** by Complib users.

![Private method icon](img/noentry.png){ width="30" } Private 
:   Contains any methods, compositions or collections which have been added to Complib but not yet published.

!!! note
    A method, composition or collection in the ``Private`` library is only visible to its owner, or to others viewing via a special link generated by the owner (see [Sharing private methods via link](methods/adding_methods.md/#sharing-private-methods-via-link)).

When performing a regular search of Complib, results will be displayed from all four of these libraries by default. However, it is possible to limit the results to those from a specific library. For more information, please see the section on [Searching Complib](search/basic.md).
