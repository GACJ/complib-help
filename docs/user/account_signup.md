# Signing up for an account
If you don't already have a Composition Library account, you will likely want to sign up for one. Account users are able to take full advantage of the many powerful features that Complib has to offer; by contrast, the functions available to non-users are somewhat limited.

## Sign-up form
[You can sign up for an account here](https://complib.org/signup). By signing up for a Complib account, you agree to the [terms of service](https://complib.org/terms) and [privacy policy](https://complib.org/privacy).

On the sign-up page you will be asked to enter some basic information, including an email address and password.

Forename and initials, Surname
:   These should be your real forename, middle initials (if you are in the habit of using them) and surname. This determines how your name will appear when you publish compositions and collections, and when you raise or comment on Issues. It is also how you will be addressed in email correspondence.

    This name should match the way you are identified in performances published to [BellBoard](https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/) and in the [Ringing World](https://ringingworld.co.uk/). **You are requested not to use a pseudonym**, as this can cause confusion as to the providence of library entries.

Email address
:   The email address which will be used to sign in, as well as receive any email notifications you have [subscribed to](user_profile.md/#user-subscriptions). It is also used to identify your account if you need to [recover your password](reset_password.md), so you should make sure it is entered correctly.

Password
:   The password for your account. There are no special character requirements, but you should as always endeavour to choose something secure.

Once your information has been entered, click **Sign up** to complete the registration process.

## Confirming your email address
Once you have successfully signed up, you will need to confirm your email address before you are able to log in to your account. Instructions for how to do this will have been sent to the email address you entered when signing up.

If you cannot find the email, make sure to check your spam folder.

## Problems with signing up
If you encounter any problems while attempting to sign up, get in touch by sending an email to [support@complib.org](mailto:support@complib.org), ideally from the email address that you are trying to sign up with.

If you are unable to confirm your email address for whatever reason after successfully signing up for an account, you should get in touch directly rather than attempting to sign up again.

## Multiple accounts
If you already have a Complib account, you are requested **not** to sign up for additional accounts. Creating additional accounts conveys no advantage, and at worst may be interpreted as an attempt to deliberately falsify information.

## Deleting an account
If you want to delete your account for any reason, you can do so from your [user profile page](user_profile.md/#deleting-your-account) when signed in.
