# User profile and settings
Once you have signed up for an account and logged in, your user profile page can be accessed by clicking your account name in the Navigation bar:
<center>
![User profile button](../img/user_profile_button.png){width="300"}
</center>

The user profile page displays important information and settings tied to your account, grouped under a number of headings.

## User Profile
This section contains basic account details such as your registered name, email address, and user type. Some of the entries here can be adjusted by [editing your profile](#editing-your-profile).

Forenames & Last name
:   The forenames and last name of the account holder. **Editable**.

Email address
:   The email address which the account is registered to. This is the email used to log in, and to which any email notifications are sent to (see [User Subscriptions](#user-subscriptions)). **Editable**.

User type
:   Indicates whether the account is a Basic or Power user. Some of the more powerful Complib functions such as [extended searches](../search/extended_search.md) are restricted to Power users. **Not editable**.

Account status
:   Indicates whether the account is active or inactive *(PD: more clarification on what this means?)*. **Not editable**.

Date registered
:   The date and time at which the account was created. **Not editable**.

## User Subscriptions
This section indicates which (if any) email notifications your account is subscribed to. Your user preferences for certain Complib functions are also listed here. Your user subscriptions and preferences can be changed by [editing your profile](#editing-your-profile).

### Email notifications
All Issues
:   Notifications will be sent whenever any Issue is opened, updated, or closed (see: Raising an Issue).

My Issues
:   Notifications will be sent whenever an issue you opened is updated or closed.

Composition Requests
:   Notifications will be sent whenever a new composition request is opened (*PD: at least, I assume so. I have never personally used this*).

All News
:   Notifications will be sent whenever a new News item is published to the Complib homepage.

### Functionality
These settings control the appearance and behaviour of some Complib features.

Show hunt bell properties in method view and search
:   Adds a **Hunt bell properties** tab to both [method pages](../methods/overview.md) and [method searches](../search/method_search.md). These properties can, for example, be used to explicitly specify a hunt bell path when searching for methods.

Show jump methods and compositions in searches
:   By default, Complib does not show methods and compositions including jump changes in searches, though they can still be viewed with a link. Enabling this setting will allow such methods and compositions to be searched for directly. 

    For more on jump changes, see [Method properties > Changes](../methods/method_properties.md/#changes) and [Place notation > Jump changes](../methods/place_notation.md/#jump-changes).

## Changing your password
To change the password used to log in to your account, click the ![Icon: padlock](../img/icon_padlock.png){width="25"}**Change password** button at the top right of the user profile page. You will be asked to enter your existing password as well as the new one.

If you have forgotten your password, you can [reset it](../user/reset_password.md) via the login page (NB: requires logging out).

## Deleting your account
You can delete your Complib account entirely by clicking the ![Icon: delete](../img/icon_delete.png){width="25"}**Delete** icon at the top right of the user profile page. You will be prompted to confirm that you are sure before the account is deleted.

!!! warning "Warning: Account deletion"
    You should think very seriously before deleting your Complib account. 
    
    Once an account is deleted, you will no longer have access to any private methods, compositions or collections you created with it. In addition, you will no longer be able to edit any public compositions which you have published using the account.

    If there is a problem with your account which you feel might be fixed by deleting and remaking it, you should instead consider raising an Issue under the **Help** category (*PD: unless getting in touch with you directly is better, GACJ?*).
