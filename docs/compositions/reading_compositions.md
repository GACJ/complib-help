# How to read compositions
Compositions have historically been recorded in a variety of ways. A host of conventions have developed over centuries, some of which may not be especially obvious to the uninitiated.

This section is intended as an introduction to reading and interpreting compositions as they are commonly encountered, such as in your Ringing World Diary, or on Complib itself. 

!!! note "Callings versus Layouts" 
    It's important to remember that **a composition is defined by its calling**, but not by its layout or style of presentation. The same composition can be represented in many different ways. Indeed, Complib gives users [a lot of control](layout_options.md) over the way that any composition appears to them. 


## Calling formats
There are two roughly distinct formats which callings use: those laid out by **courses**, and those laid out by **leads**. How you read a composition and derive calling information from it depends largly on which layout type has been used.

### Laid out by courses
A typical composition laid out by courses may look something like this:

Not all the labelled elements may be present, and there may be others not shown here. 

The calling is laid out in a table, which should be read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Each table row represents a course (or a set of courses). 

The **courseheads** give the first row of each course (or set of courses). Since all compositions begin from rounds, the first coursehead is almost always rounds. By convention, bells which do not change position between courseheads are usually omitted altogether.

The **calls** are represented by symbols which are arranged into columns. The headings of these columns are the **calling positions**, which indicate when the calls in that column are made.

In compositions of Spliced, changes of method must be indicated. This is usually done using **method mnemonics**, which are alphanumeric codes which represent the methods in the composition.

### Laid out by leads
