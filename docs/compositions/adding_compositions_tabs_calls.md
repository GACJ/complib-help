# The Calls tab
![Calling tab example](../img/calls_tab_example.png)

The Calls tab is a table which allows you to define any custom calls which are used in a composition.

Unlike the [Methods tab](adding_compositions_tabs_methods.md), you do not need to enter anything into the Calls tab in order to create a valid composition. This is because Complib has a number of default calls which account for the majority of those used in actual compositions.
