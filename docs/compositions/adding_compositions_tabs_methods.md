# The Methods tab
![Methods tab example](../img/methods_tab_example.png)

The Methods tab is a table which allows you to specify which methods are used in a custom composition. Every composition must have at least one specified method. 

If you have already filled out the [Title](adding_compositions_tabs_general.md/#title) field under the [General tab](adding_compositions_tabs_general.md), then the Methods tab may already be populated with one or more entries.

To add a method to the tab, begin typing its title in the [Method title](#method-title) column. As you type, Complib will attempt to auto-complete with the titles of any matching public methods, or private methods which you own. Once a recognised method title has been entered, the rest of the tab will automatically populate with default values appropriate to that method.

## Adding methods from a collection
You can also add methods directly from an existing method collection. This can be useful if you need to add a large number of methods to the tab.

To add methods from a collection, click on the dropdown menu above the methods table, then click on a method collection. The table will be populated with all the methods in that collection.
