# Customising composition layouts

The composition layout options menu can be accessed by clicking the cog button at the top right of a composition page's [Layout tab](overview.md/#layout).

This opens a window which allows you to customise the appearance of composition layouts across Complib.

Once you have selected the layout options you want, click `Save changes` to save your changes and close the options menu. Your new layout options will be reflected in the Layout tab. Clicking `Close` or the cross in the upper right will close the window without saving your changes. To restore Complib's default layout, click `Default settings`.

!!! note
    Compositions layouts for **single-method** and **spliced** compositions are configured separately. If you are not seeing changes you make reflected in the layout of a composition, check that you are configuring the correct composition type.

The following sections outline the different customisation options. Certain options may only be applicable to single-method or spliced compositions.
