# Composition properties
Compositions entered into Complib are automatically processed and their various properties determined. These properties are listed in the composition page's **Properties tab**.

## The Properties tab
![Composition properties example](../img/comp_properties_expanded.png)

When expanded, the top of the tab shows a number of checkboxes, each of which corresponds to a different potential feature of the composition. These properties are arranged into a number of groups.

### Structure
Backstroke start
:   The vast majority of compositions are designed to be started at handstroke. If the composition is designed to be started at backstroke instead, it will be indicated here.

Mid lead start
:   The composition begins at a point other than the beginning of a lead/division.

Mid lead finish
:   The composition finishes at a point other than the end of a lead/division.

Variable hunt
:   There is a change of principal hunt bell(s) during the composition.

Variable cover
:   The cover bell changes during the composition.

### Methods
Spliced
:   The composition involves multiple methods.

ATW
:   The composition is "all the work", meaning that all working bells ring every place bell of every method in the composition at least once.

Mixed stage
:   The composition includes methods at different stages (e.g. Triples and Major).

Change every lead
:   There is a change of method at the end of every lead in the composition (for compositions of spliced).

Every lead different
:   No working bell ever repeats a place bell in the composition.

Jump method
:   The composition includes one or more methods which have **jump changes**.

### Calls
Standard calls
:   The composition uses calls belonging to one, and only one, of the **standard call types**. These are:

    - **Near calls**: Fourth's place bobs and singles;
    - **Far calls**: n-2's place bobs and singles;
    - **Grandsire**: Grandsire-type calls;
    - **Stedman**: Stedman-type calls.

    A composition using multiple different standard call types will not be listed as using standard calls.

Twin bob
:   The composition exclusively uses pairs of bobs at S, L, Q and/or H (for compositions of [Stedman Triples](https://complib.org/method/27985)).

Jump calls
:   The composition includes calls which cause jump changes.

No calls
:   The composition does not include any calls.

Tenors together
:   The tenors (the two largest numbered bells in compositions of Minor, Triples and Major; bells 7 and above at higher stages) are in their home positions at each course end in the composition.

Strictly tenors together
:   The positions of the tenors (the two largest numbered bells in compositions of Minor, Triples and Major; bells 7 and above at higher stages) within the coursing order are not affected by any calls in the composition.

Multipart composition
:   The composition is expressed as a number of repeated parts (with potential alterations in some parts).
