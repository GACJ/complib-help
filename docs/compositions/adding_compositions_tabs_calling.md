# The Calling tab

![Calling tab: Middleton/Johnson calling](../img/calling_middleton.png){width="400"}

The Calling tab is a spreadsheet in which the calling for a composition is defined. The calling specifies the sequence of calls (such as bobs and singles) which need to be made during a performance, including changes of method in Spliced.

## Editing the calling

To edit the calling, simply click on a cell in the table and type a value to enter it into that cell. 

Multiple cells can be selected by clicking and dragging. Alternatively, you can click on a cell, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd>, and then click on another cell to highlight a rectangle with those cells at opposite corners. Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> and click to select multiple individual cells.

⌫/<kbd>Backspace</kbd>/<kbd>Delete</kbd> will delete any values in selected cells.

Right-clicking on a cell will open a contextual menu, allowing you to manipulate the table by inserting or removing table rows and columns:

### Copy-paste from other sources
In many instances you can save time by copy-pasting a calling from another source. This might be another web page, or a file on your computer.

With the calling highlighted in the source, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>) will copy. Then, in the Calling tab, select **a single cell** and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> (<kbd>⌘ Command</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>) to paste. 

The calling will be pasted into the table such that the selected cell is in its top left corner.

In many instances you will have to clean up the calling after copy-pasting, as the text formatting in the source can cause problems. Copy-pasting tends to work best if the original is in **plaintext format**, such as a composition attached to a performance on BellBoard.

## Anatomy of callings
Throughout the history of change ringing, a number of conventions have developed as to the form and format of compositions. The Calling tab aims to closely emulate some of these conventions.

If you are not already familiar with how compositions are read and laid out, you should consider reading [How to read compositions](reading_compositions.md) before trying to define one of your own.

!!! note "Callings versus Layout"
    It's important to remember that **a composition is defined by its calling**, but not by its layout or style of presentation. The same composition can be represented in many different ways. Indeed, Complib gives users [a lot of control](layout_options.md) over the way that any composition appears to them. 
    
    When defining a custom composition on Complib, the most important (and pretty much only) task is to correctly define the calling.

Callings are entered into the calling tab laid out by **courses**.

Some compositions have additional parts to their callings, and some may not have all the parts labelled here. The following sections contain information on the most common calling features, including what they represent and how to reproduce them in the Calling tab.

## Calling positions
The calling positions are column headers which provide information to the conductor about when [calls](#calls) in the table should be made. **A calling position must be a single uppercase or lowercase letter [A–Z, a–z] or a positive whole number**.

Compositions generally use one of two types of calling position: named positions (represented with letters), or numbered positions.

### Named calling positions

### Numbered calling positions

### Twin-bob calling positions

### Using custom calling positions

## Calls

### Calls in multipart compositions

## Courseheads

### Manipulating course length

## Methods

### Method substitutions, etc.

## Named blocks
