# Composition Library Help

[Composition Library](https://complib.org) is an interactive tool for all change ringers, not just conductors and composers. It is intended to act as a comprehensive reference for **methods** and **compositions** and has a number of useful features. For example, you can:

- [Search](search/basic.md) for existing methods and compositions by **name**, **title**, or a large number of other criteria;
- Display the [blue line of methods](methods/blueline_options.md) or compositions, as well as other detailed information;
- Find compositions which are **true to a particular method**, or methods which are **true to a particular composition** via an [extended search](search/extended.md).

By registering for an account, you will also gain the ability to contribute material to the Composition Library. You might:

- Define [new compositions](compositions/adding_compositions.md) and [methods](methods/adding_methods.md).
- Create [collections](collections/adding_collections.md) of methods or compositions (e.g. your personal favourites, or the hottest new 23-spliced).
- Ask questions, raise issues and request bespoke compositions from other Complib users.

## Using the Help
You can navigate this website using the sidebar: simply click on the section or subsection you'd like to read. Alternatively, you can look for help on a specific topic using the **search** feature.

For more information about the Help and how to raise an issue, please refer to the [About](about.md) section.

## A Note on Terminology
The change ringing terms used in this documentation are those specified in the Central Council's [Framework for Method Ringing](https://framework.cccbr.org.uk/version2/index.html), and many of them are common parlance within the Exercise. It is assumed for the purposes of using the Help that you are familiar with at least some of this language.

In order to be as clear as possible, definitions have been included where it is felt this might aid understanding of a particular topic. However, in the interests of brevity, this documentation does not attempt to give precise definitions for every piece of terminology. 

The Central Council Framework deals primarily with methods. By contrast, there is currently no technical specification for terminology relating to compositions. As such, greater priority has been given to defining all important compositional terms within the Help itself.
