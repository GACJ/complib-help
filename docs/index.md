# Composition Library Help

The [Composition Library](https://complib.org), also known as Complib, is an interactive tool for all change ringers, not just conductors and composers. It is intended as a comprehensive reference for **methods** and **compositions** and has a number of useful features. For example, you can:

- [Search](search/basic.md) for existing methods and compositions by **name**, **title**, or a large number of other criteria;
- Display the [blue line of methods](methods/blueline_options.md) or compositions, as well as other detailed information;
- Find compositions which are **true to a particular method**, or methods which are **true to a particular composition** via an [extended search](search/extended.md).

By registering for an account, you will also gain the ability to contribute material to the Composition Library. You might:

- Define [new compositions](compositions/adding_compositions_overview.md) and [methods](methods/adding_methods.md).
- Create [collections](collections/adding_collections.md) of methods or compositions (e.g. your personal favourites, or the hottest new 23-spliced).
- Ask questions, raise issues and request bespoke compositions from other Complib users.

## Using the Help
You can navigate this website using the sidebar: simply click on the section or subsection you'd like to read. You can also look for help on a specific topic using the **search** feature.

For more information about the Help and how to raise an issue, please refer to the [About](about.md) section.

## A Note on Terminology
The change ringing terms used in this documentation are those specified in the Central Council's [Framework for Method Ringing](https://framework.cccbr.org.uk/version2/index.html), and reflect the definitions given there. It is assumed for the purposes of using the Help that you are familiar with at least some of this language.

Definitions have been included in the Help wherever it is felt this might aid understanding. However, the Help is not intended as a replacement for the Central Council Framework, and does not attempt to give exhaustive definitions for every term used.
